It's okay, Finn shrugged, this isn't the first time she's stayed over there, so we're used to her not being home sometimes.

None

And you're just now mentioning that she crashes at Burt's sometimes? Puck smirked.

None

Quinn laughed lightly, he's not a big fan of it, but like I told him; it's no different than if Burt and Kurt stay over at our place, she added as they moved into the warm living room.

None

Yeah, I guess, Finn shrugged.

None

Dude, Burt's a good guy
None

You don't have to worry about anything, Puck assured him.

None

I know, Finn nodded, it's just..
None

weird to know my mom's..
None

you know?

None

Puck glanced at his mom, now pregnant, yeah, I know exactly what you mean
None

It's weird, but if she's happy, then what's wrong with that?

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

True, Finn agreed, not looking at it that way, I guess I never thought of that.

None

Can we go play in the snow now? Arin asked, breaking the silence after Finn's last comment.

None

The room laughed lightly, but Puck nodded, I'm in, he grinned.

None

I'll get Abby changed, Rachel commented.

None

Are you sure, Rachel? We can watch her, David said.

None

No, it's alright
None

She's never been in snow before I want I want to get some pictures of her in it..
None

She shouldn't be out long though, Rachel explained, getting up.

None

...

None

Dressing up in layers, everyone got ready to go outside
None

Finn and Quinn returned to their place to get some more clothes on to be outside in and after getting herself ready, Rachel went into the nursery with Abby and dug out some clothes for her to put on
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Adding an extra pair of clothes, she then put on a pink snow suit, consisting of a pair of fluffy pants and jacket, along with a matching hat
None

Adding a pair of mittens, Rachel was satisfied, I think you look cute, she commented, picking her up and snuggling her, then grabbed a warm blanket and wrapped it around her, as she carried her downstairs.

None

Babe, she's only going out for a little while, I don't think she needs to be dressed up that much, Puck said, trying not to laugh at how much Abby looked like a pink marshmallow.

None

I just want to be sure she's warm
None

I don't want her getting sick, Rachel replied, I want to get some pictures of the house and yard before we start messing it up walking around, so do you mind if I went out first for a few minutes? She asked.

None

Go for it, Puck motioned to the door, I'll take Abby.

None

Rachel handed him Abby and and then headed outside with her camera and as soon as she was out of the house, he started laughing, Abby, you look like a pink marshmallow, he told her, kissing her cheek, her face her only visible skin.

camera has no Synonyms in the API
['head', 'with', 'camera']

Oh, Rachel's just being cautious, Deborah said, we dressed you pretty much the same, she added.

None

I know, he smirked, then shrugged, oh well
None

I can bring these pictures out when she's got friends over, he added with a grin, moving out onto the porch.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel moved around the front of the house, taking pictures where she wanted and motioned for everyone to come further outside when she was done, how should we get Abby into the snow? She asked curiously.

None

Puck had held onto Abby while Rachel took pictures and when she motioned for everyone to join her, he carried her carefully over towards Rachel, following the footsteps of those that had gone over the pathway before.

None

The snow was still coming down, but not as bad as it had been the day before and as soon as Abby was no longer sheltered by the house, she began looking around, seeing all the bright white stuff that she wasn't used to and as the little snow flakes started hitting her face, she'd turn her head and try to shake them off, lifting her gloved hand to her face to wipe it away, I think this is a good start, he smirked, then bent down a little and picked up a small bit of untouched snow and sprinkled it over her face.

None

Noah! Rachel gasped, be careful.

None

It's fine
None

She's just checking it out, he replied, seeing her batting at it, but also her tongue was coming out, like she was trying to lick her face.

None

Rachel had taken a few pictures of her, even though she was shocked at what he'd done, and picked up some more snow with her free hand, but this one she balled up and rubbed the piece against her cheek, watching her pull back and look at what was in Rachel's hand.

hand has no Synonyms in the API
['pick', 'snow', 'with', 'hand']

I have an idea, Puck said, could you take her for a second?

None

Sure, Rachel reached out and took Abby from him, curious what he was doing.

None

Puck stepped a few feet into the grassy yard and then turned around, plopping down into the snow crossed-legged so it compacted and he could have a lap, now hand her to me.

None

Noah, what are you doing? Deborah gasped.

None

You're going to get sick! Rachel added.

None

No, I'm not, he replied, holding out his hands for Abby, I've got two layers of pants on.

None

Rachel gave in, handing Abby over and as soon as Puck had her in his arms, he kissed her and then settled her onto his thigh, her back to his chest
None

With one hand on her stomach so she didn't slip, he took the glove off of her hand closest to the snow and rubbed her hand for a moment, Abby, what is this stuff? He asked, placing her hand on the snow near his leg.

None

For a moment Abby stared at the white stuff curiously, then balled her fist up, feeling the soft snow, then let go, but with a bit of snow on her hand, she lifted it to her mouth and licked it, then returned her hand to the snow, squishing it and grinning as she picked up some and let go of it in her lap, giggling.

bit has no Synonyms in the API
['lift', '-PRON-', 'with', 'bit']

She definitely likes it, Puck said with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API

Yes she does, Rachel agreed, having been taking pictures of them.

None

What are you guys doing? Finn asked, him and Quinn returning with warmer clothes on.

clothe has no Synonyms in the API
None

We're letting Abby experience snow for the first time, Puck replied, turning his head to Rachel, I got more lap left
None

Wanna join me? He asked her.

None

Rachel hesitated, but then handed her camera to David and carefully slid into his lap, trying to keep from sitting on the snow as much as possible, and took one of her gloves off to do the same thing Abby and Puck had done with the snow.

snow has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'snow']

David took a few more pictures and Kona, who Deborah had on a leash, walked over to them and laid down near Puck
None

Abby, getting the hang of the snow, balled it up and tossed it over towards Kona and giggled.

None

Everyone got a kick out of Abby and though she was having fun, Puck and Rachel put her glove back on so her hand didn't get too cold and soon the four of them were having a family picture taken of Kona, Abby, Puck and Rachel.

None

Why don't you all join them, Quinn suggested to the others, holding her hand out for the camera.

None

David handed her the camera, and the four adults and Arin joined the rest of their family and Quinn snapped a few family photos, and before they moved much, Rachel looked at them, these are better than any professional ones, she admitted, grinning, thank you, Quinn.

None

No problem, she smiled, not feeling any desire to be a part of Abby's 'family', as her mom, but was happy to be around as Aunt Quinn, knowing she was right where she needed to be and could see her grow up, from a distance.

None

...

None

Getting cold and not wanting to stay outside any longer, after pictures were over, Deborah suggested she take Kona and Abby inside, letting everyone else stay outside a little longer.

None

Are you going to go change? Rachel asked, wiping off the snow as she stood up.

None

I was going to, but I probably won't
None

I'll be fine for a while longer, Puck shrugged, standing up and shaking the snow off.

None

Alright, but if you get sick, don't say I never warned you, she replied.

None

Puck smirked, leaning over and picking up some snow and tossing it to her, a little snow can't hurt anyone.

None

Noah! Rachel gasped, but instead of saying anything else, she picked up some more and tossed it to him, fair's fair, she giggled, ready to be a teen for once; she never had snowball fights when she was a kid and knew it was time to have some fun.

None

...

None

It didn't take long for 'throwing the snow back and forth' to turn into a full on snowball fight between Quinn, Finn, Rachel, Puck and Arin, while the dads watched them and did the adult thing by cleaning some of the snow off the cars, but since they didn't plan to go anywhere, they gave up after a while.

None

While they were all outside, they hadn't had any traffic go by on the road and it was pretty quiet out, until they heard an explosion, stopping all of them from what they were doing
None

What was that? Puck asked concerned.

None

Probably a transformer, Ethan replied, glancing around, and saw Deborah come outside, did the power just go out?

None

Deborah nodded, yeah and the news said the snow should blow over soon, but hard telling how long it will be before the the power is back on.

None

What do we do? Finn asked.

None

I'd say go home, get some warm clothes on and come back over here, Ethan said, motioning inside Puck and Rachel's house
None

I'd call your mom and see if they lost power, too
None

It's probably just our area, but at least let her know in case they try to come over here later, Ethan suggested, and let them know you'll be here, so if she needs to call she knows where to.

None

Alright, we'll be over in a while, Finn nodded, him and Quinn shaking off the snow and heading towards their house.

None

I'll be over in a few minutes
None

Gonna go get a few things
None

Deb, you need anything? Ethan asked, looking at Arin, and I know you're going home to change, he added.

None

Arin nodded, moving towards Ethan and Deborah called out that she didn't need anything, so Ethan and Arin returned to their house while the rest headed into Rachel and Puck's.

None

...

None

I can't believe the power went out, Rachel commented as she and Puck went up to their room to change into dry clothes.

None

I'm not, Puck replied, stripping down, it's the first snow storm we've had since last winter
None

Trees are weak in places and with all the snow we've gotten, they could easily be knocked down or some dumb ass tried to have some fun and crashed into a power pole, he said, pulling on a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt.

None

Oh, well, there is that
None

I didn't think of those reasons, she admitted, putting on warm pants and one of Puck's sweatshirts.

None

Puck watched her for a moment, smiling when she put on his shirt
None

Moving towards her, he slipped his arms around her and pulled her in for a kiss, you know, we should try to keep warm, so we could get in bed, he winked.

None

Warmth rushed to her cheeks that turned them a light pink, I'd like that, but I couldn't with our families and friends downstairs.

family has no Synonyms in the API
['like', 'that', 'with', 'family']

Leaning down, he pressed a kiss to her neck, then her ear, what would it take to persuade you? He murmured, kissing her lips, before moving down to the other side of her neck as his arms held her close.

None

Later, Noah, she promised, they'll come looking for us if we're not down there soon.

None

He sighed, alright, but I'm holding you to that, he replied.

None

I promise, she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him lovingly, let's finish getting dressed.

None

He nodded and for the next few moments they focused on putting on warm socks and a decent layer of clothes, before leaving their room and returning to the living room to find Alan, David and Deborah down there with Kona and Abby, they're not back yet? Puck asked, meaning Ethan, Arin, Finn and Quinn.

kona has no Synonyms in the API
None

No, but I imagine they'll be over soon
None

I'm sure dad is getting out his portable police scanner to see what's going on, Deborah replied, when they all get over here we'll need to figure out what to do for dinner.

None

Okay, why is Abby on the couch? Puck wondered, seeing her laid out on the couch with a pillow next to her so she couldn't roll off and a warm blanket over her.

pillow has no Synonyms in the API
['lay', 'with', 'pillow']

She shouldn't be on the floor because heat rises, Rachel said, you know that.

None

Oh, yeah, that's right, he nodded, smirking.

None

Rachel moved to sit down next to Abby, pulling her legs under her and got Abby into her lap, using Abby's blanket to cover both of them, I hope the power doesn't stay out for too long
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's nice that we're all together, but it's what? One in the afternoon and it's only going to get colder tonight.

None

Don't worry, I'll keep you warm, Puck promised, joining his family on the couch.

None

I know, she smiled at him, I'm just worried about Abby.

None

As long as you keep a blanket over her and just make sure she doesn't seem cold, she should be fine, Deborah assured them.

None

Hearing the door open, they looked up and found Arin, Ethan, Quinn and Finn had returned, taking off their shoes and knocking the snow off in the doorway, before moving further into the living room, well, it's stopped snowing, Ethan commented, taking a seat on the other couch where Deborah was sitting.

None

That's a good thing, Puck agreed, what is all that?

None

Ethan unzipped the small bag he brought over, battery powered police scanner, and I also brought over a radio and some glow sticks
None

Figure if we needed them, we can use them later when it gets dark out.

None

Oh sweet
None

Mom was mentioning what we're gonna do for dinner, too, Puck replied.

None

We have our gas grill on the deck, Ethan told him, and I know we filled up the gas tank after we used it last
tank has no Synonyms in the API
None

That should cover us for most things
None

Finn, did you get a chance to talk to your mom?

None

Yeah
None

She said power is out there and they're snowed in, too..
None

Well, she said Burt could probably get Kurt's SUV out, but mom's car isn't going anywhere until probably tomorrow and it's still pretty nasty out to be driving in, Finn explained.

None

Then you guys should stay over here tonight
None

There's a spare bed in Arin's old room you can use
None

No need to be alone over there, Rachel suggested.

None

Are you sure? Quinn asked, I mean, we have a few flashlights and blankets and what not over there, we'll be fine.

None

We're sure, Puck told them, stay
None

But you may wanna go back just to get some more clothes, in case you want another layer on later.

None

Quinn and Finn nodded, alright, thanks, Finn replied, we'll go over later and get some things.

None

Good, Rachel smiled and looked at Ethan, have you had a chance to talk to anyone at the station? Is there any word on if school will run tomorrow?

None

No, he shook his head, if we don't have power, chances are McKinley doesn't have it either, along with a few other schools in the area, so I wouldn't plan on it
None

The district can't be open if half the schools don't have power, Ethan replied.

None

Okay, well, as soon as we do get power, we're going to need to call a Glee meeting for sometime this Winter Break, Rachel commented.

None

Why? Puck asked.

None

Remember how we didn't pick songs for Regionals on Monday? She asked and when the others nodded, she continued, well, we were going to meet today during Glee and discuss the songs again
None

Since there isn't any school today and maybe not tomorrow, we should plan something for next week sometime so we can figure songs out
None

We can't wait until we get back to school to figure them out, she told them.

None

Puck nodded, oh yeah, I forgot about that
None

Well, we should have everyone's number so in the next few days we'll need to come up with a time.

time has no Synonyms in the API
None

Speaking of scheduling, Deborah turned to Quinn, if the weather doesn't clear up, you may want to reschedule your mom's visit
None

She's got a trip ahead of her to get up here.

None

Quinn nodded, yeah, I know
None

I think the roads will be okay by Saturday, as long as there won't be anymore snow
None

If things are still bad tomorrow I'll call and reschedule
None

I just really want this to be over.

None

Do you not want to see her? Rachel asked.

None

I do want to see her, but it's like..
None

We're both different people now
None

I don't know how well she's going to take to how I've changed, Quinn explained.

None

She's your mom
None

If she wants back in your life, she better accept it, Puck told her.

None

Yeah, I get that
None

I just..
None

I'm nervous
None

She'll pretty much be meeting all of you and it's a big deal, Quinn replied.

None

It is, but we're all here for you, Ethan told her.

None

Thanks, Quinn smiled.

None

...

None

Unable to do a lot, Rachel suggested they play a game and Monopoly was chosen, but instead of everyone playing, they split up into four teams: Arin, Ethan and Deborah as one team, David and Alan as another, Quinn and Finn worked together and Puck, Rachel and Abby were on the other one
None

Sitting around the coffee table, with a few candles as light, they rolled the dice and moved around the board, paying each other and having a healthy competition.

candle has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'candle']

As it got closer to dinner time, Deborah suggested they figure out what they're going to have, so Ethan went out to start the grill and Deborah carefully went into the fridge and freezer to get some frozen hamburgers and hot dogs; something Puck and Rachel always had
None

Ethan put a tea kettle on the burner of the grill and warmed up some water for drinks and between that and the food they came up with; having to open cans with a manual can opener, they came up with a pretty good dinner.

manual has no Synonyms in the API
['open', 'can', 'with', 'manual']

Now that darkness had fallen on Lima, and with the streetlights out, it was pretty dark out and Rachel was lighting candles all over the downstairs and Ethan had turned on the radio he'd brought over, wanting to hear if there was any announcements for school or the power.

streetlight has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'streetlight']

Finn and Quinn had planned to return to their house, long enough to get some warmer clothes, and stay at Puck and Rachel's, but it got cooler, they decided to actually go home and stay, figuring they'd be more comfortable in their own bed
None

Around eight, they said 'goodnight' and headed home, thanking everyone for dinner and for the offer to stay.

None

Shortly after they left, David and Alan headed up to bed, tired from the early morning and Ethan mentioned the district would probably wait until morning to cancel school, so after blowing out candles and gathering things up a little, Deborah, Ethan and Arin headed back to their house and Rachel, Puck and Abby headed up to the nursery, laying a few more blankets down in Abby's crib and once her diaper was changed, they settled her down and covered her up, hoping she'd stay warm.

None

Deciding they might as well go to bed themselves, Puck and Rachel moved into their room and Puck closed the door behind them, definitely feeling the cold settling in the rooms, since the heat hadn't been on since that afternoon.

None

It's cold in here, Rachel murmured, moving over to the closet and dug out their extra comforter, then shook it out and laid it over their bed.

None

Puck had been carrying the flashlight and with one hand helped her fix the blanket, then kicked his shoes off and climbed under the blankets in his sweats and sweatshirt, yeah it is, but I'm sure we can find a way to warm up.

hand has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'with', 'hand']

Rachel joined him, crawling as close to him as she could, I did say 'later', didn't I? She wondered, kissing his lips in the very dim light from the flashlight.

None

You did, he nodded, and as long as we keep the blankets over us, we shouldn't get too cold.

None

Some how I have a feeling we'll warm up pretty quickly, she murmured, taking the light from him and setting it on his nightstand so the light didn't shine right on them, but nearby so they had some light, you have that effect on me.

None

Puck smirked and slid his cool hand under her shirt, you don't have to ask me twice, he murmured, wrapping his arms around her and kissed her lovingly, and I'll definitely help you warm up.

None

Oh, I know you will, she agreed, shivering a little at his touch, but already felt her body warming up.

Snuggling close to each other, Rachel and Puck helped each other stay warm under the two heavy comforters and blankets they had on their bed
None

Their room was pitch black, except for the flashlight that Puck purposely left turned on so they'd have some sort of light.

None

Sometime in the early morning, before sunrise, Puck woke up and noticed their alarm clock was flashing '12:25', which he knew was wrong, so he glanced at his watch, seeing it was just after four-am
None



None

 he thought, shifting a little.

None

What's going on? Rachel murmured, waking up when she felt her boyfriend move.

None

Power's back on, he replied, reaching out to set their clock so it would stop flashing.

None

Oh, that's good, she said softly, sticking her arm out of the blanket to feel the room warmer than it had been when they went to bed the night before
None

I should go check on Abby, she added.

None

Puck smiled, leaning over and kissing her forehead, no, I'll go do that
None

You stay here.

None

Okay, she returned his smile and settled back into the pillows.

None

After warming up the night before, neither had put any clothes on, so as Puck crawled out of bed, he threw on a pair of boxes and a t-shirt before quietly stepping out of their room and moving down to the nursery
None

Going inside, he carefully went over to the crib and checked on Abby, seeing her sound asleep
None

Sleep well, baby girl, he murmured, before leaving the room and returning to bed, she's sound asleep, he commented as he closed the door.

None

Good, Rachel smiled sitting up a little bit.

None

You put clothes on, he noted.

None

Yeah, I figured we could take the extra blanket off the bed and still stay warm, she said, motioning to the end of the bed where she'd folded it up.

None

Works for me, he shrugged, crawling back into bed
None

I vote for a few more hours of sleep, he commented, wrapping his arms around her.

None

Sounds good to me, she replied, settling back in his arms and pressing a kiss to his cheek.

None

Puck smiled and tugged the blankets back over them and let sleep take over.

An hour after Puck and Rachel got back to sleep, the phone rang again, and this time Rachel answered it, when Puck refused to
None

Finding out school was canceled that day, she returned to bed and the two went right back to sleep, glad for the early start to their Winter Break.

None

Sleeping as late as they could, they finally got up for the day around eight-thirty and found David and Alan just coming in from outside
None

They'd cleaned their car off the rest of the way and got it cleared from the snow so they could get it out, oh, we were just going to leave you guys a note, David admitted.

None

Where are you going? Rachel asked.

None

We're going to go home, Alan replied, to check on things there and I need to go to the office for a few hours and try to catch up with my missed work.

Oh, um, are you sure it's alright to be driving out there? She glanced outside, seeing the road had been plowed right down the middle during the night.

None

Yes it is, sweetheart, David assured her, we've been here two nights and though I don't have to go to work because they closed the clinic yesterday and today, dad's gotta go catch up on work, he said.

But we'll be back this evening for dinner, then we'll go home tonight and be over at the Hudson's sometime before Quinn's mom shows, Alan explained.

None

Rachel bit her lip, but nodded, alright
None

Just be careful
None

I'll call Quinn and find out exactly when she invited her mom over so I'll let you know tonight, she replied.

None

Alright
None

Sounds good, David nodded, wrapping his arms around her, we'll be fine, he promised.

None

We'll call when we get home and be over around four-thirty, Alan replied.

None

Okay, Rachel said reluctantly.

None

Puck was standing next to Rachel, with Abby in his arms, and after the two men hugged Rachel, they said 'goodbye' to Puck and Abby and headed out to their car, having already put their bags in it earlier.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel watched them leave and then followed Puck into the kitchen, I didn't expect them to leave so soon, she admitted.

None

Well, like they said, your dad had to get to work for a while, and wanted to check on their house, Puck replied, settling Abby into her high chair.

None

Yeah, I know, but I just..
None

Wish they would have waited a few more hours, she said softly.

None

Babe, relax
None

They'll be fine, he assured her, wrapping his arms around her

None

Taking a deep breath, she nodded, relaxing in his arms, you always know what calms me down, she murmured.

None

Puck pressed a kiss to her forehead, because I don't like seeing you worried or stressed out, he explained, so I help out where I can.

None

She smiled and stood up on her tip toes, kissing his lips, thank you.

None

He grinned, no thanks needed, babe.

None

...

None

Taking the time to feed Abby and eat breakfast, David called to assure Rachel they'd made it home safely and they'd be over later on that day, so Rachel relaxed from the worry she had and focused on the day.

None

After eating, Rachel and Puck took turns showering and then settled in the living room
None

Rachel sat on the couch, leaning over the coffee table, already starting on homework they'd gotten a few days prior, Puck was on the floor, leaning back against the couch, playing a video game, Kona was nearby, laying down on a fluffy dog bed and a blanket was laid out in the middle of the floor not too far away from Puck with Abby on it, occupying herself with stuffed toys and a rattle they'd given her to play with.

['occupy', '-PRON-', 'with', 'toy']

You know, we do have two weeks off, Puck commented, pausing his game.

None

I know, but we've missed two days of school and the sooner we get it done the better, she replied, looking at him and something out of the corner of her eye caught her attention, so she turned to look at Abby, oh my! She gasped, look!

None

Puck looked towards their daughter and saw her on her hands and knees, crawling towards him
None

She'd been getting close to crawling, but would always fumble and stop trying, no matter how much anyone would coax her to continue, but this time, she was going for it, without stopping
None

That's my baby girl! He grinned, setting the game controller on the floor, spread his legs out and let her keep crawling, holding his hands out for her, come on, come to daddy, he coaxed.

None

I've gotta get my camera! Rachel exclaimed, jumping up and heading to where she'd left it the day before, near the stairs, so she was still able to keep her eyes on them.

None

Hearing the commotion, Kona perked up, watching what was happening
None

Abby kept going towards her dad, grinning and gurgling a little when Puck started talking to her and when she finally reached his hands, he picked her up and hugged her, good job, baby girl! I'm so proud of you! He said, feeling his emotions on high at what had just happened.

None

Me too, Rachel agreed, kneeling down next to him and showing him the picture she managed to take of Abby crawling towards his open hands
None

She leaned over and pressed a kiss to Abby's forehead, our baby girl is growing up, she added, feeling tears in her eyes.

None

Yeah she is, Puck agreed, why don't you go sit by the TV and see if we can get her to crawl to you, he suggested, taking her camera.

None

Okay, Rachel nodded, taking his suggestion and moving to sit across the room, spreading her legs out like Puck had, hey Abby, come here
None

Come to mommy, she said happily.

None

Puck returned Abby to the floor to see what she'd do and within a few seconds, she was crawling towards Rachel, so Puck stood up and was able to get a similar picture to what Rachel had gotten of him and Abby.

None

While Abby crawled this time, Kona got up and moved closer, in protection mode, but didn't get in the way
None

She, Puck and Rachel were watching as Abby kept crawling to Rachel without stopping and when Abby reached her mom, Rachel picked her up and snuggled her, oh, sweetie, I'm so happy, she murmured, tears falling from her eyes, mommy loves you.

None

Talk about an awesome day, Puck commented, moving to Rachel and wiping her eyes, I also think it's time to set up the play pen, he added with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's a very awesome day, Rachel agreed, and I do believe it is time for that and also time to start baby proofing the house.

None

Puck smirked, now we know what we'll be doing over the break
None

I figured we'd have to start soon anyway; now we know for sure, he explained.

None

We do, Rachel nodded in agreement.

None

...

None

Passing on the news to family and friends that Abby was crawling, prompted return messages of 'that's awesome', 'congratulations' or similar statements that were just as happy as Puck and Rachel were
None

Susan responded that she'd have to get some baby gates to put up in the house to keep Abby from getting anywhere she shouldn't and Puck and Rachel agreed they'd have to start doing the same thing.

None

Pushing aside what they had been doing, the young couple spent the rest of the morning on the floor, crawling around with Abby, who was definitely interested in checking out the rest of the living room, now that she was mobile.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Kona was quiet protective of Abby, not being more than a few feet from her at all times and Puck and Rachel didn't mind, because she stopped Abby a few times from getting too close to the brick fireplace that they never used, before either of them could catch her.

None

As lunch time rolled around, Deborah, Ethan and Arin came over and they had lunch together, then got a chance to see Abby crawling around first hand
None

They were just as happy to see her moving around as Puck and Rachel had been and also noticed Kona keeping close watch of her, glad to have her there, because they knew as both Kona and Abby grew, Kona would continue to be protective of Abby.

None

Deborah and Ethan had also come over to find out what Puck and Rachel were out of, because they were going to make a trip to the store and Arin didn't want to go, so Puck and Rachel were going to let her hang out with them.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Once the two adults left, Rachel took Abby upstairs for a nap, because she was starting to show the signs of being tired and when she returned, Puck and Arin were watching TV.

None

I should really call Mr
None

Schuester and find out what we're going to do with the Glee Club plans, Rachel commented.

plan has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'what', 'with', 'plan']

What plans? Puck asked.

None

About how we're going to pick the songs for Regionals, since there's no school
None

We can't wait until we go back in January to pick them, she explained.

None

Puck nodded, yeah, I get ya
None

I remember talking about it
None

Well, we'll be busy tomorrow and a lot of them go to church on Sunday, so that's probably out, but we could meet on Monday
None

I guess they could come over here, though that's a ton of people to have in our house.

None

It would be, she nodded, but we've had that many over before; besides, I don't think everyone will show up
None

The original members and a few of the new ones for sure will be here, but I don't know about the rest.

None

We don't really need everyone here, either, Puck added as an afterthought
None

I mean, with the original members and some of the new ones, plus the directors, that's almost twenty people
member has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'member']

That's a majority
None

If not everyone can come, those who can't will have to deal with the songs since they weren't here to help pick them, he explained.

song has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel thought for a moment, yes, I agree, but I want it to be fair to everyone.

None

You can't always make everyone happy
None

Someone is always going to disagree
None

If you make arrangements for Monday, that's plenty of time for everyone to plan to come over; if they still can't make it, then we'll have to make a decision without them, he told her.

None

Okay, she nodded, I'll go call Mr
None

Schuester.

None

...

None

Heading up to her and Puck's room, while Rachel dug out the information list for the new club members, she called Will
None

She explained what she and Puck had talked about and he agreed that the club should meet soon to discuss music and went along with the Monday suggestion
suggestion has no Synonyms in the API
None

Finding the contact information for the new members, she offered to let everyone know and after a few minutes discussion, they agreed that noon was a good time to have everyone over at Puck and Rachel's and then Rachel hung up, so she could contact the others.

None

Staying in their room, Rachel took a seat on the bed and though she was going to first send a text message to all of the members, she held off for the moment, wanting to call Quinn to ask her about the next day.

None

Hey, Quinn, Rachel said, once she answered.

None

Hey, Rachel, everything alright? Quinn asked.

None

Oh, yeah, it's wonderful, Rachel smiled, then something hit her, I..
None

I, um, should be asking you that.

None

Me, why? Quinn wondered.

None

Because Abby is crawling..
None

It's a big milestone, Rachel said softly.

None

I'm fine, Quinn assured her, just because I gave birth to her doesn't mean I'm her parent
None

I'm definitely not
None

Abby is one-hundred-percent yours and Puck's daughter
None

It's awesome that's she's crawling, but I don't have the same feelings you do about it
None

I can't..
None

I see you with Abby and I just can't see myself being like you are
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

I hope one day when I do start a family that I'm as motherly to my kids as your are to Abby, but right now, I couldn't be like that, she explained, pausing for a moment, and we don't need to go through this every milestone either, she added with a light laugh, trying to lighten the mood.

laugh has no Synonyms in the API
None

I understand, Rachel agreed, taking a deep breath, please don't take this the wrong way, but some days I worry I'm going to wake up and find this is all a dream or that you've changed your mind or something..
None

I know we've talked and you say you won't, but I just can't help but worry sometimes, she admitted, biting her lip nervously, because she knew they'd already talked about it a few times.

None

Rachel, I get that you worry, but I promise you that I am 

None

 going to change my mind
None

Period
None

Abby is yours and I'm not going to take her away from you or Puck
None

She is with her parents

I'm just the cool aunt, Quinn told her truthfully.

None

Rachel giggled lightly at the last part, thanks Quinn
None

I'm sure you're tired of hearing me bring it up, and I try not to, but I guess with everything that went on with your mom at Sectionals and then tomorrow, my worries have resurfaced a little more, she admitted softly, and now it sounds like I don't trust you, but I do.

everything has no Synonyms in the API
mom has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'mom']

It's okay
None

I get it and it doesn't bother me that you ask, but hopefully after tomorrow you won't have to worry anymore, Quinn explained, you'll see that Judy, um, my mom, means what she says and you'll trust her.

None

I hope so, Rachel nodded, trying to relax, speaking of Judy, what time is she going to be over? When would you like us over? She asked trying to change the subject.

None

I asked her to be here about noon, so I'd like everyone over before she gets here, so between eleven and eleven-thirty, how's that? Quinn replied.

None

That sounds good
None

We were just curious and I need to let Susan know so she can be ready to watch Abby for a while, Rachel admitted.

None

Alright, Quinn nodded, hey, um, thanks for going along with that
that has no Synonyms in the API
None

I just really think that having her around right off the bat might be too much.

None

No worries
None

It's the same reason why I didn't take her when Noah, Deborah and I went to meet Shelby the first time, Rachel explained.

None

Oh yeah, that's right
None

I forgot about that, she admitted.

None

Rachel nodded, oh! The other reason I was calling was to tell you about Monday
None

I just spoke to Mr
None

Schuester and he agrees that the club should meet sometime over break to pick songs, so I'm calling the meeting for noon, on Monday, here at the house, she said
None

I wanted to talk to you first and then I'm going to go message everyone else.

None

Monday sounds fine
None

I'll tell Finn
None

Want me to let Kurt know, too? Burt, Kurt and Carole are on their way over to get us and then we're all going to the store to get stuff for tomorrow, she explained.

None

Sure, you could tell Kurt and Finn
None

I will probably send out a group text message to everyone and anyone who can come that doesn't know how to get here, I'll call personally, Rachel told her.

None

Okay, works for me, Quinn paused for a moment, I should let you go
None

They just got here and I still need to change.

None

Okay, see you tomorrow, Rachel said, be careful out there.

None

We will
None

See you then, Quinn replied.

None

Hanging up the phone, Rachel reached for the paper sitting next to her with the club members information and just as she was about to add all their numbers to her phone, she heard someone clear their throat
information has no Synonyms in the API
None

Turning around, she saw Puck standing in the doorway, hey Noah.

None

Hey
None

Talk to Quinn? He asked.

None

Yeah, she nodded, she'd like us over there by eleven-thirty tomorrow so we'll all be there when her mom arrives at noon.

None

Alright, he walked further into the room, still worried about Quinn changing her mind? He wondered, having heard part of her conversation.

None

Rachel gasped, you heard that?

None

Yeah, he nodded, moving to sit next to her on the edge of the bed, I heard that with all this that's going on, some of your worries have resurfaced and you figure she's tired of you bringing it up
this has no Synonyms in the API
None

Which I'm guessing is about her and your worries that she'll change her mind, he explained
None

I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I came up to check on Abby and you, since you hadn't been back down for a while, he added.

None

It's okay
None

I don't mind
None

I..
None

Yes, I did mention it
None

Given that Abby started crawling today and I told everyone, I wanted to see if she was alright, you know? She said, continuing on, briefly explaining what she and Quinn had talked about.

None

Well, I'm sure Quinn told you this, but she's not going to change her mind
None

I trust her word and I also am sure that Judy isn't going to try something, he promised, wrapping his arms around her.

None

Rachel relaxed against him and took a deep breath, I wish I could be as sure as you are, she murmured, I just can't seem to shake it.

None

Puck rubbed her back and kissed her forehead, I wish I could take your worry away
None

Maybe tomorrow once you have a chance to talk to Judy, you'll relax more, he suggested.

None

That's kind of what Quinn said
None

I hope that happens, Rachel replied, if not, I'll just try to push it aside and not let it bother me, she said, I'm trying to do that now, but it doesn't seem to work.

None

Maybe I could try to help you forget, he smirked, with a little physical education.

Noah! Arin's downstairs, Rachel gasped, blushing deeply with his suggestion.

suggestion has no Synonyms in the API
None

So? She won't bother us and Abby's still asleep, he winked.

None

Taking a moment to breathe and relax, she was tempted to take him up on the offer, but her mind was still cluttered with other things and didn't think she'd be able to focus, as tempting as that sounds, Noah, I need to contact the club members and...

None

Puck pressed a finger to her lips, hold on, he murmured, standing up and moving to their door
None

Closing it, he returned to her and took her phone and the papers she had on the bed and laid them on the corner of her nightstand, you've got all weekend to call a meeting, he said softly, taking a seat next to her
None

His hand lifted up to rest against her cheek, his thumb brushing gently against the soft skin, and you're wound up from emotions, so let me help you relax for a while, he suggested.

None

Listening to his words, Rachel leaned into his hand and let her eyes drift closed, slowly starting to relax
None

Feeling how her body reacted to just his hand, she knew the closer she got to him the more relaxed she'd feel, so she smiled and opened her eyes, looking at him, make love to me, Noah, she whispered.

None

Studying her face for a moment, Puck returned her smile and leaned forward, kissing her lips gently, gladly.

None

...

None

Puck didn't expect Rachel to go for his suggestion, but when she did, he gladly showed her love and care as they joined together and shared some intimate time together
None

As the two slowly settled back against the pillows, relaxed and snuggled under the blankets, they soaked in the time they had, but knew they couldn't stay there forever.

None

Abby soon woke up, which was their indication to return to reality, so they got dressed and went back to what they had been doing earlier
None

Rachel sent the message to all the Glee members about the meeting on Monday while Puck took care of Abby and then Rachel called Susan to make plans for her to watch Abby, before finally joining Puck, Abby and Arin in the living room.

None

Deborah and Ethan returned from their shopping trip a little later and brought over what they'd gotten for Puck and Rachel's house, along with what they'd picked up for dinner, so Deborah and Rachel got to work on that while Ethan and Puck watched Abby and Arin.

None

David and Alan arrived around four-thirty and they got a chance to see Abby crawling and were just as excited as everyone else had been
None

Everyone in the house all started to chip in getting dinner ready and when they sat down around five-thirty, the family ate and got a chance to celebrate Abby's milestone, no one in a hurry for her to have many more, though they knew that she would continue to grow and couldn't wait to learn more about her.

None

After dinner, everyone settled in the living room to chat or watch TV like they usually did and Rachel told them about Quinn's plan for the next day
None

They agreed to be over at the Hudson's by eleven-thirty and before it got too late, David and Alan decided to leave, even though Rachel assured them they didn't have to
None

The two men wanted to sleep in their own bed and Rachel did understand that, so they said 'goodnight' and left, promising to see everyone the next day
None

Once they were on their way home, Ethan, Deborah and Arin chose to head home themselves, since it'd been a long day and wanted to be well rested for the next one.

None

Looks like it's just you, me, the dog and the kid, Puck commented, kicking back on the sofa, but his eyes were glued to Abby, crawling around on the floor, checking out a few of her toys they had down there with her.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

It looks like it is, Rachel agreed, we really should get the play pen set up
None

It's up in the nursery, she told him, and I already washed the sides and mat cover, so it just needs to get put together.

None

I know
None

We just haven't needed it yet, he sat up a little, I'll do it tomorrow
None

No need to get it out now
None

She'll be going to bed soon, he admitted.

None

True, she agreed, would you like to..
None

um, she blushed, continue where we left off earlier?

None

Rachel Marie Berry, are you asking what I think you're asking? He grinned, pulling her into his arms and kissing her lips.

None

Returning his kiss, Rachel smiled, her blush deepening, yes, she replied, I am.

None

Maybe we should get Abby ready for bed and we can have the rest of the night to ourselves, he suggested, I mean, it is almost her bedtime anyway, he winked.

None

Rachel glanced at Abby, who was sitting on the blanket they had laid out entertained by one of her toys, maybe we could spend a little more time with her and then get her ready for bed, she suggested, then I'm all yours, she added, wanting to spend some more family time with her.

We could do that, too, he nodded, shifting a little and slid off the couch onto the floor, then patted the carpet next to him, spending 

None

 kind of time with you is awesome and what's almost as awesome is having family time.

None

Joining him on the floor, Rachel folded her legs under her and leaned against him, I definitely agree
None

They are two of my most favorite things..
None

Abby, she cooed, patting Puck's leg and smiling.

None

Hearing her name, Abby grinned, shaking her rattle a little and then crawled over to her and reached up, wanting her to pick her up.

None

Rachel happily picked her up and hugged her gently, I love you, sweetie.

None

Puck shifted and wrapped his arm around her and Abby and kissed both of his girls' foreheads, then smiled, I love you both.

None

...

None

Spending a little more time together, Abby began to get sleepy, so after a light bedtime snack and a bath, Puck and Rachel got Abby dressed in her pajamas and carefully laid her down in her crib for the night.

None

Taking care of a few things downstairs, soon Rachel and Puck were turning in for the night, enjoying the alone time and this time Rachel wasn't worried that someone would interrupt them, because they knew the house was empty except for them, Abby and Kona.

None

When morning arrived, they were up around eight, had breakfast and started getting ready for the day
None

Puck had some free time, so he put together Abby's play pen, giving her some space to crawl around and play in without getting near anything she could hurt herself on
None

It took him a little longer than the directions said, with many colorful words being used, but it wasn't too long before Abby was in it, checking out her new space.

None

While she was in her pen, Puck relaxed and kept an eye on her while Rachel filled up her diaper bag with things and soon she was finished and taking a seat on the couch next to her boyfriend, we should go soon

It'll take us some time to walk over to your aunt and uncle's house, she said.

None

Yeah, I know
None

I'm ready whenever you are, he admitted.

None

Help me get Abby changed? She asked.

None

Sure, he nodded.

None

Taking some time, the two dressed her up in her warm winter jacket and pants and Rachel made sure to add a few more sets of clothes for her just in case she needed them
None

Once the two had gotten their jackets on, Puck carried Abby while Rachel threw the bag over her shoulder and began their short trek a street over to Ben and Susan's place.

None

With a lot of snow still on the ground, Puck and Rachel walked down the strip of road that had been plowed so they didn't slip, but were still careful for ice; Puck didn't want to fall with Abby in his arms
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

It took a few extra minutes than normal, but they finally arrived and dropped Abby off, finding Arin, Deborah and Ethan there; they had walked Arin over so she could spend the day with Hannah, Ben and Susan's younger daughter, the same age as her.

Talking for a bit, the four said 'goodbye' and made their way back to the Hudson's house and saw Kurt's SUV outside
None

Knocking on the door, Finn answered it moments later, and everyone moved inside, taking the time to greet Carole, Burt, Kurt, Quinn and Finn
None

Once everyone had their jackets off, Puck, Finn, Ethan and Burt went into the living room while Rachel and Deborah chipped in with the preparations in the kitchen and it was about eleven-thirty when David and Alan arrived.

With everyone there, except Judy, Quinn was now even more nervous than she had been and was starting to pace in the living room as she watched outside for Judy's car.

None

Quinn, relax, Finn said, getting up and moving towards her.

None

I can't relax; I'm so torn
None

Part of me wants to tell her off and forget she exists for what she did, but on the other hand, I know she was only doing what 

None

 said, so I keep thinking I should just forgive and forget, she explained.

None

You'll never forget, Puck said honestly, but it's what she does from here on out that will prove she's sorry for what she did, so you can forgive her
None

Things just need time, he told her, remembering from personal experience.

None

Quinn nodded, yeah, you're right and I know that, she agreed, taking a moment to relax
None

Glancing outside she saw her mom's car and took a deep breath, she's here, she said softly.

None

...

None

Moving to the door, Quinn greeted Judy first and invited her inside
None

Once she had taken her jacket off and hung it up, they moved into the living room and Quinn looked around, I'd like you to meet my family, Quinn told Judy honestly, motioning around and introducing David, Alan, Rachel, Puck, Ethan, Deborah, Finn, Carole, Burt and Kurt.

None

Looking around as Quinn said their names, Judy nodded in greeting and took a deep breath, I'd..
None

I'd like to thank you all for accepting my daughter into your lives, she started, I know what happened was unacceptable, but at the time, I didn't have any say in the matter
None

I'd always followed along with my ex's plans because he was the one who had the job and money, but not anymore

['follow', 'with', 'plan']

What he did to Quinn should have been the deciding factor, but I didn't know what to do at the time and was still blinded by several things
None

When we moved, things changed and it took me a while, but when I finally realized he was cheating on me, I woke up, took my life into my own hands and filed for divorce
None

You'd think after being married as long as we were, that I'd be upset that we're split up, but I'm not
None

I'm relived to be rid of him and I hope now that he's out of the picture, I can..
None

I can rebuild a relationship with Quinn
None

I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm willing to do anything to have you back in my life, Judy explained, turning to Quinn as she said the last of her speech.

None

Quinn glanced at Puck, remembering what he'd said just before Judy had arrived and bit her lip, I think I told you this when we saw you this weekend, but I can't just forget what you did or forgive you
None

I know he was controlling, but you had so many opportunities to contact me and you never did
None

I need time.

None

Judy nodded, I know and I'm willing to give you all the time you need
None

I'm also sorry for catching you, out of the blue, like I did this past weekend, but I didn't know any other way to meet up with you..
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rebecca said they were going to see your performance and it seemed like the best time, without you thinking I was trying to corner you.

None

Yeah, I get that now, she admitted, I know I was pretty defensive, because you caught me off guard, but I'm glad you had done that when I had others around
None

If you would have moved back here and I saw you somewhere, I probably wouldn't have talked to you, she told her truthfully
None

When are you moving back here?

None

Soon, your niece and nephew are out of school for break, so your sister and brother-in-law are going to help me bring my things up here
None

I don't have much to move
None

Most of my stuff is still here
None

I got the house, here in Lima, in the divorce, she explained, and it hasn't been touched since we left earlier this year.

None

Quinn nodded, okay, she paused, I don't even know where to start.

None

How about we get our food and come back in here and we can talk over lunch, Carole suggested, breaking the nervous tension in the room.

None

...

None

Thankful for Carole's suggestion, everyone agreed with her and moved towards the kitchen to fill plates with food and returned to the living room to sit down

Judy wanted to know everything from the time Quinn found out she was pregnant and though Quinn did most of the talking, others joined in at times to explain things, including how Puck and Rachel came to keeping Abby
None

They didn't go into every detail for the time Judy had missed, but gave her enough to fill in the blanks.

None

Judy kept thanking everyone for helping Quinn out and was apologizing for the mess that she and her ex had made, but could definitely see that Quinn was happy, which is what she always wanted for her.

None

When things came up about Abby, Rachel paid more attention to the conversation, watching Judy's reactions
None

Judy was surprised Puck and Rachel decided to take on the role of parents at such a young age, but after they explained their reasons for their choice, Judy assured them it wasn't her place to judge them, because it was their life, and as long as Quinn was happy with the arrangement of letting them parent her biological child, she'd respect Quinn's choice
None

Rachel was glad to hear that and was slowly starting to warm up to Judy; her worry wasn't as strong and she was slowly getting the feeling that Judy was serious about being in Quinn's life and there wasn't a hidden reason for her return.

None

As the history telling came to an end and they were starting to talk about what was going on at school and current events, Judy turned to look at Rachel, so Rachel, I notice your daughter isn't here, she said to her.

None

Though slightly caught off guard by her comment, Rachel nodded, um, yes, we thought it might be better if she wasn't here at first
None

In case you were uncomfortable
None

She's with Noah's aunt and uncle, she explained calmly
aunt has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'aunt']

Thinking about what she'd heard that day and feeling less worried about Judy, she glanced at Puck and then back at Judy, would you like to meet her? She asked softly.

None

Judy smiled at her, I'd like that, but it's up to you, her dad and Quinn, she admitted, looking at Quinn and Puck, too.

None

I'd be okay with that, Puck said, looking at Rachel, who just nodded and smiled at him.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Me too, Quinn agreed, though it's not my decision, it's all Puck and Rachel.

None

I'll go call and have them bring her over, Rachel said, taking her cell phone from her pocket
None

Getting up she stepped into the kitchen so she wasn't interrupting the others and made the call
None

She spoke to Susan briefly and she said she, Ben and the girls would come over with Abby, knowing Jessica would want to go along and they couldn't leave Hannah and Arin alone
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

With plans made, Rachel hung up and returned to the living room, they'll be over in a bit, she announced as she retook her seat next to her boyfriend.

None

...

None

Continuing conversations while they waited, it wasn't long before Ben, Susan, Jessica, Hannah, Arin and Abby were arriving
None

Rachel met them at the door and as soon as Abby saw her, she was reaching for her, hey sweetie
None

Did you miss me? She asked, taking her from Ben as they all came inside
None

Abby snuggled up to her as soon as she was in her mom's arms and Rachel kissed her forehead.

None

Puck got up and moved over to them, greeting his daughter and while Quinn introduced the new arrivals, Rachel and Puck took Abby's winter clothes off, leaving her in a sweatshirt and a pair of sweatpants
None

Kissing Rachel's lips gently and then Abby's forehead, Puck looked at them, a silent question of 'are you sure?' being asked and when Rachel nodded, he smiled at her and let her lead.

None

With Abby in her arms, Rachel walked over to where Judy was sitting next to Quinn on one of the couches, Judy, this is Abby, she said softly, turning a little so Abby was facing her.

None

Judy smiled and stood up, well hello Abby, she said, gently taking her hand and shaking it, you're adorable.

None

Abby looked at the new face and for a moment she was okay, but when Judy started talking to her, she kind of pulled back and buried her head against Rachel, sorry, she's shy with new people, Rachel commented, rubbing Abby's back.

None

That's understandable
None

I'm glad I got to see her, Judy admitted, I don't want to scare her or anything.

None

Rachel nodded, yeah, she probably will start crying, she said honestly, baby steps, she added, moving to sit down where she had been next to her boyfriend.

None

Watching the interaction between Abby, Puck and Rachel, Judy could see what others had said and knew she was in good hands, I admit I was curious to see you two with her and I can definitely see that she's where she needs to be
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

You two are great parents and she seems very happy with you both.

None

Thanks, Puck nodded at her.

None

Though Rachel still had some insecurities about Judy's return to Quinn's life, she knew that she wouldn't have a lot of interaction with Abby
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel was growing more comfortable with Judy being around and though it wasn't necessary, she was glad that Judy was able to see Puck, Rachel and Abby together and in a sense, give them her blessing to continue to be a family, thank you, Rachel smiled happily.

I had intended on just skipping over it, because they're Jewish, but I've made it clear in this fic their families celebrate both
None

I know a lot of Jewish people may not like that I bring Christmas up and I totally understand why (especially because Glee didn't even mention Puck and Rachel being Jewish in season 2's Christmas episode, and I'm sure they won't in season 3 either.), but since I focused on it last 'year' in the fic, I don't want to completely pass it over this time around, since it's Abby's first holiday season
None

I hope you enjoy how I feature it.

After meeting Abby and seeing how happy she was with her parents, Judy felt confident that Quinn had done the right thing
parent has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'parent']

She didn't show it, but she was relieved that Quinn didn't keep her, knowing the kind of responsibility raising a child was; she hated to think negatively about a human being her daughter helped create, but she just didn't feel that Quinn needed that in her life anytime soon.

None

In talking to everyone, Judy found out that Puck had enlisted in the Navy and would be leaving just after graduation in June
None

She was shocked he'd chosen a path that would take him away from his daughter, but after hearing his reasons and his and Rachel's plans, Judy understood; college wasn't for everyone and if he didn't want to go, he shouldn't be forced to
None

Rachel and Puck also told her they knew it would definitely put a strain on their relationship and family, but they would make it work and it would only be for a few years and then he'd be home and they'd have the rest of their lives together.

None

Though Quinn let them explain, she added in another threat to Judy, wanting to make sure she didn't decide to change her mind because of the new information she'd been told and Judy assured everyone she would not be changing her mind
None

She told them Abby was Puck and Rachel's daughter and if they felt that him joining the military would be a good step for their family, then it was their decision and she would not step in; she knew it would be a strain, but could see how in love Puck and Rachel were and was confident they'd make things work.

None

...

None

Staying for a little longer, Judy decided to leave a little after four, since it was starting to get dark, knowing she had a drive back to Columbus and it was still pretty cold out
None

Saying 'goodbye' to everyone, Quinn walked her to the door and gave her a hug, promising sometime over the break they'd get together.

None

Once the woman was gone, Quinn retook her seat and looked at Rachel, so, I honestly didn't think you'd want her to meet Abby, she told her.

None

Rachel blushed a little, well, I hadn't planned it, but I guess after hearing what she said, I got more comfortable with her, she explained.

None

I'm proud of you, Puck smiled, currently entertaining Abby with one of her plush toys, I was going to mention we could offer to introduce them, but I didn't know how you'd take it, so I didn't say anything, he admitted.

one has no Synonyms in the API
['entertain', 'abby', 'with', 'one']

If you had, I would have said 'no'; I needed to make the decision on my own, she told him, and I'm still not totally sold on it, but I think I do believe that she means what she says.

None

That's a start, Quinn smiled, and I know I probably didn't have to mention anything about you joining the Navy, but I wasn't taking any chances, she added, looking at Puck.

None

Puck smirked and nodded, yeah, I know
None

Thanks
None

Remind me never to get on your bad side, 'cause you can be nasty.

None

Finn laughed lightly, you think that's bad? You ought to see her when she's...

None

Dude, I wouldn't finish that sentence if I were you, Puck warned him, then laughed.

None

Realizing the words had started to come out before he'd been able to stop them, he blushed and nodded, thanks, man, he mumbled, ducking his head to avoid the glares from the women in the room.

None

How do you feel after all of this? Rachel asked Quinn after a few moments.

None

I'm alright, she admitted, taking a deep breath, I'm far from great, but she seems to genuinely feel bad about what she did and wants to rebuild our relationship
None

I won't be moving in with her or anything like that, but I definitely want to see how things go, Quinn explained.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

That's a good place to start
None

She doesn't seem like she's expecting you to move back home and pick up where things left off like nothing happened, so she seems open to following your lead, Rachel replied.

None

Quinn nodded, yeah, I got that from her, too, because if she started trying to force me to do something or tell me what to do, I'd be changing my mind about wanting to get involved with her, she told them.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Well, coming from experience, I think things will work out enough that you two can have a relationship again, Puck said honestly, if that's what you want.

None

I do want to have a relationship with her, Quinn admitted, I'm just going to need time.

None

Exactly
None

You guys made great progress today; that's more than a lot of people start with, so you're moving in the right direction, David assured her.

None

Thanks, she smiled, and thank you all for being here
None

It would not have been this easy if you guys hadn't been here.

None

Just as Quinn said that, Abby crawled onto Rachel's lap and snuggled against her, as if she wanted to sleep in her arms and Rachel smiled, that's what family is for, she commented, holding Abby and pressing a kiss to her forehead, and with that, I think we should get someone home for a nap, she added.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, I could use one, Puck commented seriously, but he was doing it to make a joke, hoping it'd lighten up the room.

None

Noah, I meant Abby, Rachel laughed lightly.

None

Puck smirked, I know, babe, but it made everyone laugh; that was the point.

None

...

None

Sticking around for a short time to help clean up, soon everyone began to leave the Hudson's, knowing the weather still wasn't the greatest and the Puckerman's and Berry's headed back to Puck and Rachel's house
None

Once they got Abby down for her nap and Kona had a chance to go outside for a few minutes, they all settled in the living room.

None

You know, I just realized something, Rachel commented, taking a seat next to her boyfriend on the couch, we haven't even really talked about what we're doing for Christmas
None

We don't have a tree up yet, and I know we're Jewish, but we do celebrate both holidays, she explained.

None

Well, we've had other things going on and with the snow storm a few days ago, it kind of threw everything off, Puck told her, but what do you want to do?

None

I don't know
None

I know dad and daddy are having their party this Thursday, so we have to go over there and decorate and all, but what about here? I mean..
None

You guys never did the outside decorations and you spent most of the Christmas break at our house last year and what are you guys doing? She looked at Deborah and Ethan.

None

We were going to talk to you tonight, actually
None

We were kind of hoping you all would like to celebrate Christmas at our house this year, Deborah admitted, we picked up a new artificial tree and are going to set it up tomorrow
None

We'd like you guys all to join us
None

I figured with Abby now crawling it probably wouldn't be a good idea for her to be around one, unless you're really careful and I don't know if Kona would mess with it
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

And David and Alan were amazing last year, letting us celebrate with them, so we'd like to return the favor, Deborah explained with a smile, and it's the first Christmas since we got back together.

You don't have to repay us, but I do like the idea of spending it together, David smiled.

None

What he said, Alan motioned to David.

None

Rachel glanced at her boyfriend and nodded in agreement, I think that sounds like a great idea! I mean, the holiday season is about being with family right?

family has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'family']

It definitely is, Puck nodded, wrapping his arms around his girlfriend and hugging her.

None

...

None

Since the families had a late lunch, they chose to have a light dinner around six and talked about when to be over at Ethan and Deborah's place the next day
None

Making plans to come over by one to decorate and have dinner, the family finished their meal and continued to talk for a little while.

None

Abby didn't get put down for her nap until almost five, so she was asleep most of the evening and after dinner, though the young couple didn't expect everyone to leave, their parents and Arin returned to their homes, leaving Rachel and Puck so they could have some time to themselves.

None

It's not that often we get an evening alone, Puck admitted, pulling his girlfriend into his arms as they sat on the couch.

None

Rachel nodded in agreement and settled into his arms, no it isn't often
None

Though Abby will be up until late though, she added.

None

Yeah, but that's just because she didn't get her nap until later today, so her sleep schedule is off a little
None

She'll be back to her usual routine in a few days, he assured her.

None

True, she agreed, and I guess it doesn't really matter; it's not like we've got school for a few weeks, so she could off a little.

None

Exactly, Puck grinned, I'm surprised you seem okay with that, he added.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Well, I will miss school, but I'm looking forward to all the family time we'll get together, she said honestly, shifting to straddle his hips, because we've only got six months together and then it could be a lot of missed time
None

I'm definitely supporting your choice, but I'm still going to miss you like crazy, she admitted softly.

None

Puck slid his arms around her, gently pulling her against his chest, I'm going to miss you, too, baby, so much
None

Just remember I'm always coming home to you and Abby and I'll do anything I can to get time off so we can see each other, he promised.

None

I know, Rachel nodded, pressing a kiss to his lips, I know you'll always come home to us
None

I never doubted that, she assured him.

None

He smiled, good, he reached up and brushed a hand along her cheek, talking about this today brought things up, huh? He asked softly, knowing she hadn't talked much about him leaving, until it was brought up with Judy.

judy has no Synonyms in the API
None

Biting her lip, she nodded, yeah
None

I just realized that the last few months have gone by pretty quickly and these next ones will be going by just as fast
None

Pretty soon Abby will be a year old, your brother or sister will be born, you'll be graduating from high school and then going to boot camp..
None

Things that seemed so far away over the summer don't seem that far off now, she explained.

None

Yeah, I know what you mean, he pressed a kiss to her lips and hugged her, rubbing her back gently, I'm glad I'll get to meet my brother or sister before I go, and be at Abby's first birthday party, but the time apart is going to be horrible
None

It's so hard to explain my reasons for wanting to do this, he admitted.

None

Rachel took a deep breath and nodded, kissing him gently, I know, Noah
None

You don't have to explain
None

We've talked about it and I'm pretty sure I get it
None

I also know that you can't change your mind now, because you've already been sworn in.

None

That too, he nodded, and like it was said today
None

We'll make it through.

None

We will, Rachel nodded in agreement and kissed him, relaxing against his chest.

None

...

None

Letting their conversation settle, Puck and Rachel snuggled on the couch for a little longer and Abby woke up around the time she normally went to bed, so after feeding and changing her, the family sat down on the floor and enjoyed the time together.

None

As eleven-pm rolled around, Puck and Rachel were getting tired and though they knew Abby had slept later in the evening, they gave her a bath and got her ready for bed, finally laying her down about midnight, hoping she'd fall asleep and not stay awake too much longer, because they didn't want her to be too off her schedule.

None

Getting to bed themselves, just a little after Abby, Puck and Rachel both fell asleep quickly and hoped to sleep in for a few hours in the morning.

None

Having set their alarm for nine in the morning, neither expected to be able to sleep until it went off, but as it began to beep right at nine, Puck woke up and was surprised, but that quickly changed to worry because Abby hadn't woken them up
None

Getting up as calmly as he could so he didn't disturb Rachel, he quickly moved into the nursery to find Abby perfectly fine and just snuggling with one of her stuffed animals
one has no Synonyms in the API
['snuggle', 'with', 'one']

Relieved, Puck picked her up and greeted her, moving her over to the changing table to check her diaper
None

Changing her, and then redressing her, he took her into their room, laying her right between him and Rachel.

None

When her boyfriend and their daughter entered the room, Rachel smiled and shifted a little, greeting Abby with a kiss when Puck laid her down next to her, good morning, sweetheart
kiss has no Synonyms in the API
['greet', 'abby', 'with', 'kiss']

Did daddy wake you up? She wondered.

None

No, actually she was already awake
None

I thought it was odd that she hadn't cried to wake us up and I went to check on her
None

She was hanging out with one of her stuffed animals, he explained, sliding back under the covers.

one has no Synonyms in the API
['hang', 'with', 'one']

Rachel nodded, her hand gently resting on Abby's stomach and tickling her a little, getting a giggle from her, I see
None

Well, we appreciate the extra sleep time, sweetie, she told her.

None

Puck nodded in agreement and leaned over, pressing a kiss to Rachel's lips, I totally agree, he smiled and settled in.

None

With the footsteps upstairs, Kona, who had gotten used to sleeping downstairs on her dog bed, wandered up and joined her family, laying at the side of the bed, as if knowing that Abby was there and she was protecting her.

None

The family relaxed in bed, but just a little bit after Kona had joined them, she heard something and started barking loudly, scaring Abby, who started crying
None

Oh, it's okay, sweetie, Rachel picked Abby up and snuggled her, trying to calm her down, what did Kona hear?

None

I don't know, Puck admitted, shifting from bed, but she won't stop so something is going on, he explained, slipping some warmer clothes and shoes on, I'll go check, he told her.

None

Rachel nodded, be careful, she said, still calming Abby down.

None

I will, but I'm sure she just heard a bird or something outside, Puck shrugged, I'll be back.

None

We'll be here, she replied.

None

Okay, Puck nodded and after leaning over to kiss Rachel and Abby quickly, he left their room and headed downstairs, finding Kona at the back door, barking and growling
None

Pulling back the curtain, he glanced around, seeing the snow kind of melted in some areas and the grass of the backyard was slowly showing through, dude, dog, what the hell? Did you scare the crap out of Abby for nothing? Puck asked the dog, still growling and barking at something
None

As he said that, his eyes landed on the small door going into the garage and saw it ajar, is that what you're barking about? The door? He glanced at the dog to see she was looking in that direction, I'll take that as a yes, he smirked, then pulled his phone out of his pocket, glancing for new messages
None

Seeing one from his dad, he read it and nudged Kona, stop it, it's just dad, he told her, opening the sliding door a little to slip out, but he couldn't get the door shut fast enough and Kona lunged out, running towards the garage.

None

With a sigh, Puck followed her, heading towards the garage and pushed the door open, morning dad, what are you doing? Puck asked as soon as he was inside and saw Ethan's head over some boxes.

None

Morning, Ethan greeted him, moving some things around, I'm looking for the tree decorations, he replied, sorry
None

Hope I didn't wake you.

None

No, we were awake, but Kona heard you and started barking, so that startled Abby
None

Want some help? He asked.

None

Yeah, that'd be great
None

You at least know what we're looking for
None

Your mom said it was in a box, but she couldn't remember what color, he smirked, and with all my stuff in here from the move, which I know I need to go through, it's a lot harder to move around in here, he explained.

stuff has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'stuff']

Okay, give me like ten minutes to go let Rachel know and I'll be back, Puck replied.

None

I'll be here, Ethan laughed, nodding.

None

...

None

Heading upstairs to let Rachel know what was going on, Puck changed into jeans and a hoodie, then rejoined Ethan in the garage
None

Kona hadn't left the garage since she'd first gone in there, but had stopped barking, now that she knew it was Ethan.

None

The garage was a mess with boxes and things piled all over
None

It hadn't always been like that, but when they needed the nursery, what they stored in that room was moved into the garage, along with everything else that had been in there already, like Puck's weights
None

Not only that, but when Ethan moved back, all of his stuff from Detroit was stored in there
None

He had planned to clean things out over the summer, but after spending the time fixing up the house across the street, purchasing almost everything new, so Rachel and Puck could keep the things in the house and because he'd returned to work, time had run out for cleaning and it was put off until later
None

Now with all the extra things in the garage, they had to move stuff around to get to what they were looking for.

thing has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'with', 'thing']

Rachel and a warmly dressed Abby joined them a little later, not really getting into anything, but curious what they were doing and when the guys finally reached the boxes they were looking for, Puck, since he knew what ones they needed, handed off the boxes and Ethan piled them by the door.

None

Peeking inside the largest box, Rachel found an artificial Christmas tree, you know, we still may be able to put up a tree
None

I think it'd be kind of neat if we did; it's the first holiday season we've had a chance to have our own tree, Rachel admitted.

None

With the last box in his hands, Puck came to stand next to Rachel, if you want to put this one up, we can, babe, he told her.

None

Glancing at Abby in her arms, she bit her lip, I kind of feel torn
None

I mean, you always see the 'Baby's First Christmas' ornaments and outfits and yes, we are Jewish and she's already had her first Hanukkah and we made it special, but I also want her to experience Christmas, too, but I feel, she blushed, to quote you, 'like a bad Jew'.

None

Puck smirked, good one, Rach, he pressed a kiss to her lips, we can celebrate both, just like we always have
None

You and your dads and my family and I always did, so there's nothing wrong with us doing the same thing
None

When we were talking last night and mom mentioned they'd gotten a new tree, and wanted all of us to celebrate together, I thought we could put this one up anyway
None

We could decorate it with ornaments that we always had on our trees, to make it ours, he explained.

ornament has no Synonyms in the API
['decorate', '-PRON-', 'with', 'ornament']

Rachel smiled, I love that idea, she nodded, we can still celebrate with the family, but we'd have our own tree
family has no Synonyms in the API
['celebrate', 'with', 'family']

I don't think Kona will mess with it and Abby does have her crib that we can put her in and she doesn't crawl around on the floor unless we're with her, so we'll keep her from it, she said.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, Puck nodded, sounds like a plan
None

Sometime this week before the holiday we'll decorate it, he told her.

None

A lot of families wait until Christmas Eve day to decorate their tree, Ethan commented, trying not to intrude on their conversation, but felt he could add to it, or before, it all depends on traditions and I think this is the perfect time for for you guys to start your own.

None

I think that's a great idea
None

We could do it Christmas Eve morning
None

I still have shopping I want to finish and we can pick up some new ornaments and stuff to add to it, too, Rachel grinned, bouncing Abby on her hip a little causing Abby to giggle, this is going to be fun!

None

It will be, Puck agreed, you guys should head inside and dad and I are going to take this stuff over to their house, then I'll come back over and get showered and stuff.

None

...

None

To save a step, Puck and Ethan took the pieces of the artificial tree into the house and set it up in the living room, planning to take care of arranging things later
None

While Rachel, Abby and Kona stayed inside, Puck and Ethan made a few trips over to the other house, dropping off the boxes they'd dug out and Puck returned home to shower and get ready for the day.

None

As Puck came downstairs, he paused at the sight in the living room
None

They had set the tree up in the middle, and Rachel was standing next to the tree with Abby, who was reaching out and touching the fake branches, this is a Christmas tree
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

We are Jewish and celebrate Hanukkah, but we also celebrate Christmas, because daddy and I did with our families and I think you should experience both
family has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'family']

Some Jewish people might not agree, but my dad and your dad's dad were not Jewish growing up, so to that's why our families always did both, Rachel explained simply
None

As grandpa said earlier, it's time for us to make our own traditions so sometime this week we're going to decorate it and have our first Christmas tree as a family
None

We'll still celebrate with our families, but it'll be nice to have our own tree, too.

family has no Synonyms in the API
['celebrate', 'with', 'family']

Puck smiled, watching them and listening to Rachel talk to Abby and as she finished her speech, he walked into the living room and slid his arms around Rachel and Abby, nice speech, he murmured, pressing a kiss to Rachel's lips and then Abby's forehead.

None

Thanks, Rachel smiled, it's true
None

I want us to have both because we both did and I'm excited
None

We never decorated for Hanukkah; it was always for Christmas and I love decorating.

None

I know, Puck nodded, and I'm totally cool with it, but let's not go too far, he smirked, remember the fiasco from last year? He asked curiously.

None

Rachel blushed, nodding, yes, I remember
None

I promise it won't be that much
None

Just the tree and a few lights
None

I know we don't have a lot of money to be putting into this and we don't have to
None

I'm sure that between the ornaments and a few decorations I'll get from my dads and then what we can get from your parents, we'll have plenty.

None

Yep, that's what I'm thinking
None

You wanna go over there now or wait a while? He asked curiously, motioning across the street.

None

Anytime, actually
None

Dad and daddy will be on their way over in a little bit, she replied.

None

Alright, then let's head over
None

I can help you get Abby dressed if you want me to and then I'll walk Kona over, if you're okay carrying Abby, he suggested.

None

Okay, sounds good, Rachel nodded.

None

...

None

The day itself wasn't completely unusual for them; they were together a lot during the weekends, but this time they were also working on Christmas themed things
None

They spent the first little while setting up the tree, sorting out lights and putting them on the tree, organizing decorations and figured after dinner they'd get to the ornaments.

None

Puck and Rachel mentioned they'd decided to still put up a tree, to have their first one as a family, and though the adults were concerned because of Abby and Kona, the teens assured them they'd be careful
None

Understanding and agreeing that Rachel and Puck were both responsible and would take care of them, Puck began claiming things from the decoration boxes he wanted either on the tree or in the house and Deborah and Ethan didn't mind on some of the things, because they had gotten some new decorations, lights and ornaments to add to what they had, having thought the teens might want to do a tree that year, or in the future and it wouldn't hurt to have extra.

None

Abby slept in her car seat for a portion of the afternoon because she hadn't had her nap yet, but as soon as she woke up, she was crawling around on the floor near where Rachel was sitting, checking things out
None

Keeping an eye on her, Rachel saw Abby take a seat right in the middle of a pile of red, silver and green garlands and ribbons she'd been untangling on the floor
None

She couldn't help laugh lightly at what she was doing, picking up and shaking the strands and once Rachel was sure Abby couldn't get hurt on anything, she got up quickly to get her camera, taking a few pictures of her before she lost interest in the new items.

None

Puck was across the room and when he saw Abby and Rachel he smirked, I'm not really sure, but I don't think you're supposed to wrap those around the kid, Puck commented.

None

I'm not; she sat down in the middle of them all on her own and she seems to like them, she explained, motioning to how she was still shaking it, getting it to rustle a little.

None

Moving over to sit down next to them, Puck looked at Abby, are you helping mommy decorate? Abby, unable to really respond, kept going with what she was doing, smiling and giggling at the rustling sound she was making
None

Puck smiled and glanced at Rachel, I guess she does like them, he agreed.

None

See, I told you, Rachel replied with a grin, nudging him playfully in the shoulder.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck smirked and turned a little to wrap his arms around her, kissing her lips, you did.

None

Rachel melted into his arms and smiled, this reminds me that we never scheduled a time to get family pictures for the holiday season at all
None

Not for Hanukkah or Christmas
None

We really should, she commented.

None

Why do we need to go have pictures taken when you can do it? You're the photographer in the family, he told her, and maybe you should do it for New Year's Day
None

Abby will be eight months old that day, he suggested.

None

But they won't be professional and they should be, she replied.

None

Taking a deep breath, Puck looked at her, remember the conversation we had at your birthday dinner about you being a photographer?

None

Thinking for a moment, Rachel nodded, yeah, I do.

None

Well, there's no better time
None

I mean, you already have a nice photo printer, a digital camera and you use some of those photo editing programs to fix pictures and stuff anyway, so you've got almost everything you need
some has no Synonyms in the API
None

If you're worried you don't have a 'studio' then that's as simple as putting up a sheet on a wall, he explained
None

If you started taking pictures, and maybe talked our friends into letting you do their pictures and family photos, you could start making some money and before you're even a Senior in high school could have a good little photography business going.

None

Rachel smiled brightly, I never thought about that, but I could! That's a great idea! She kissed him, I won't say I'm an expert, but you are right
None

I do have and use Photoshop and it would definitely save a lot of time having to make appointments and working around our schedules, she admitted
None

Now we just have to find a place in the house with an open wall, she added.

wall has no Synonyms in the API
['find', 'place', 'with', 'wall']

I'm sure we can find one, Puck replied, if not, we can rearrange things.

None

I have an idea, Ethan commented.

None

The teens glanced up at him, what is it? Rachel asked curiously.

None

Well, is this something you're serious about? I mean I know it's news to us, but it sounds like you guys have talked about it before, he started.

None

We talked about it a few months ago; Noah mentioned I was really good at photography and if I was choosing not to go for Broadway and all that, I didn't have to go for a degree in it
None

He suggested I could turn my hobby into something more and study photography and have a business in it, Rachel explained.

None

All the adults nodded in agreement, you have always enjoyed taking pictures, Alan noted.

None

And I think that's a great idea; if it's something you want to do, David added.

None

It is
None

I haven't thought too much on it recently, but Noah's right
None

Now is a great time to get into it, Rachel replied.

None

What's your idea, dad? Puck asked Ethan.

None

Turning part of your garage into a studio
None

It's got to get cleaned out and it doesn't seem like you guys use it for anything other than storage, so maybe it's time to just make it a storage room on one side and a studio on the other, he suggested, glancing at the teens and then his wife, Alan and David.

None

And what about a place for my weights? I will eventually wanna use them at home again, Puck added.

None

Ethan smirked, well, we could arrange things to give you space, too
None

You know I know about remodeling and if I can't, then my brother can figure it out, he explained, it's all open for you guys and if it's something you're serious about, we can arrange it, he said looking at Rachel.

None

Rachel smiled brightly, I'm definitely serious about it, she nodded, her mind filling with tons of ideas, part of the garage being a studio is an amazing idea! I really liked Noah's suggestion when he first brought it up, because I hadn't even thought of it, and though we've had other things going on, now that he brings it up again, I've got a bunch of ideas
ton has no Synonyms in the API
None

I would love to able to have a real studio one day, like the one we went to when we had our family pictures taken, she admitted, but right now it would be perfect to have a home studio and if it's in the garage, then we wouldn't have to worry about taking up a part of our living space.

None

Exactly, Ethan nodded, and if it does pick up and you start doing photography for others, people you may not know, you wouldn't have to worry about strangers in your house.

None

Very true, she nodded in agreement.

None

Then I guess cleaning out the garage is a project for our Winter Break; at least to start it, Deborah commented, it'll give us something to do during the day, she motioned to Rachel, Puck and Arin, I'll need your help so I'm not moving heavy things.

None

You've got it, Puck nodded, as far as I'm concerned you can sit and point, then we'll do the rest, he told her honestly.

None

Deborah smiled, thanks.

None

You guys can just move my stuff to one side and I'll go through it nights after work, Ethan added, I know I've got to clean it out sometime.

None

No hurry, I mean, yes I'm excited for this, but it's not something we can really do much of until the weather gets nicer, right? Rachel asked, it's pretty cold out.

None

Possibly
None

It depends on exactly what we decide to do
None

If we're just going to remodel the inside, the sooner it's cleaned out, we can get to work, but if you guys wanted to make it bigger to still keep part of it as a garage, then that will have to wait until Spring, Ethan explained, and I guess I could move all of my stuff into our garage and that will help empty it out.

None

Well, we have a place to start
None

There's no need to sit down tonight and figure out every detail
None

We've got all break to talk about it and come up with ideas; at least we know we have to clean it out and we can start that soon, Puck commented.

idea has no Synonyms in the API
None

...

None

Everyone agreed with Puck's suggestion and seeing what time it was, they settled back into what they were doing and Deborah went to start making dinner
suggestion has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel and Arin joined her and Puck knew Rachel liked helping his mom in the kitchen, because she wanted to continue learning to cook and he thought it was a great way for his mom, sister and girlfriend to have some time to bond.

None

When dinner was ready, they all sat around the dinning room table eating and the guys helped do the dishes afterward, before they returned to the living room to start putting ornaments up on the tree.

None

Where'd mom go? Puck asked, noticing she'd disappeared.

None

I'm right here, Deborah replied, returning from her bedroom with a two boxes in her hand, I had to get something out of the bedroom.

box has no Synonyms in the API
['return', 'with', 'box']

What's all that? Arin asked.

None

Deborah took a seat on the couch next to her husband and handed him the boxes; one was small and had a single ornament in it, but the other one was a plastic storage container, I thought we could add these ornaments to the tree this year, she explained.

None

Ethan picked up the smaller box and smiled, seeing the bride and groom and the words 'Our 1st Christmas 2010' printed on it, this is definitely going on the tree, he agreed, pressing a kiss to her lips
None

Pulling back, he popped the lid on the storage container and inside was some crinkled up newspaper as packing for whatever was in side, so he pushed it aside and landed on more ornaments, you still have these? He gasped, picking up the first one, a hockey player with '20' as his number.

None

These were on our tree the year Noah was born and the following Christmases before you left..
None

I just couldn't part with them, she admitted.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Digging through it finding several other ornaments geared towards things from their past relationship, including another first Christmas one, for 1993; the year they had been married before, I honestly didn't think you'd keep these, but I'm glad you did, he said, wrapping his arms around her.

None

Me too, she agreed, and I know we've got a new start together, but I just thought we should put these on the tree, too.

None

They should be on there, he nodded in agreement, it's a great idea, he replied, standing up and taking her hand, so let's put them on the tree.

None

...

None

Starting out with putting those older ornaments on the tree, the others began sorting through the rest they had in boxes, old and new
None

Puck claimed some of his from previous years to put on his, Rachel and Abby's tree and put them aside in a storage box of things they were taking back to their house and then helped going through the rest.

None

Aside from the personal ones that had meaning, they'd gotten a lot of new ones, just colored balls and snowflakes, so all of the ones that didn't go on the tree, went into the box for Puck and Rachel's house and slowly the night wore on.

None

With the final touches on the tree, they finished around nine and everyone was happy to see the end result
None

Since it was so late, Puck and Rachel needed to get home to get Abby ready for bed, so they all decided to call it a night
None

After saying 'goodnight' to Deborah, Ethan and Arin, David and Alan helped the teens take Abby, Kona and all of their things home, so they didn't have to make a second trip
None

Once they were home safe, the two men headed home, since they had to work the next day.

None

After getting Abby bathed, ready for bed and laid down in her crib, Puck and Rachel kicked back in the living room, there's a tree blocking the TV, Puck commented with a smirk.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

Well, yes, that's where you and dad put it
None

You could move it..
None

If you don't tonight, you'll have to tomorrow morning because we have to find room for everyone to sit in the living room for the Glee meeting, she explained.

None

Oh, yeah, I forgot about that, he admitted, sighing dramatically, fine, I'll move it.

None

Rachel giggled lightly and watched him get up, moving the tree a little more out of the way, but had to move Abby's playpen, so Rachel got up and helped him
None

Maybe we should move the TV stand over a little more and put the tree in the corner
None

Well, Rachel paused, looking around, we should put one of the love seats in front of the fireplace, since we don't use it and then rearrange the rest of the furniture so it fits, because Abby's playpen shouldn't be by the fireplace and I also don't want it in the middle of the living room.

one has no Synonyms in the API
None

While she was talking, Puck had moved the tree in front of the fireplace, where they'd always put it and now that it wasn't blocking the TV, he retook his seat on the couch, grabbed the remote and turned it on
None

I'm gonna watch TV while you figure out how you're going to arrange it
None

Let me know when you decide, he smirked.

None

Noah, you could help
None

I don't remember how you guys had your living room set up with the tree last year, she commented.

tree has no Synonyms in the API
['set', 'with', 'tree']

Exactly this way, the only difference is last year we didn't have a playpen in the living room, too, he replied.

None

Oh, she looked around, I suppose this would be okay..
None

I just don't want the playpen to be in the middle of the floor, but should be near the couch so we can still see her.

None

Puck got up and nudged the recliner near the couch a little bit, then slid the playpen in between the couch he'd been sitting on and the recliner; a perfect fit and spot
None

There was nothing she could reach for that she could get hurt with, there was no tables or electrical outlets near it where anything was dangerous and it was close to everything, but still out of the way, so no one tripped over it
that has no Synonyms in the API
None

How's that? He asked curiously.

None

Rachel smiled, that's great, Noah
None

It's a perfect spot
None

I didn't even think about it, she admitted.

None

Walking over to her, he wrapped his arms around her body and pressed a kiss to her lips, it's okay, babe
None

You're not used to this living room
None

We still have it set up the way we did when it was just me, mom and Arin, so I'm more familiar with it, he told her.

None

Very true, she agreed, snuggling into his arms, today was fun.

None

Yeah it was, he nodded, guiding her back to the couch
None

Abby was adorable.

None

She was, she grinned, she loved that garland
None

I didn't expect that
None

I guess because it was shiny and something she'd never seen before.

None

Puck nodded, yeah, it probably caught her attention, he said, taking a seat and getting her to settle into his arms again.

None

Relaxing for a moment, Rachel took a deep breath and tried to let all her thoughts and ideas from the day slow down in her mind
None

We should probably go to bed soon, she said softly.

None

It wouldn't hurt, he shrugged, how much earlier are you going to be up because of everyone coming over? He asked with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel blushed, um, seven..
None

Mom and Arin are going to the store and getting drinks and snacks, so we may have to cook some things
None

I know we're also ordering pizza, but we still need to make sure we have room for everyone, get some paper out and that kind of stuff
None

I also don't want laundry and toys all over the place, she admitted, motioning to some of the baby toys around on the couches or the floor.

None

Good point, but they should also understand we have a baby
None

No one is going to expect it to be spotless, he commented.

None

I know, but I just want everyone to see that even though we are teen parents, we can still manage things, you know? I don't want someone to see a mess and think we can't handle our situation; some of them will be here for the first time and I want to make a good impression, she explained.

None

Looking at her, Puck nodded, yeah, I get that, but I really don't think anyone is going to care
None

The original members are our friends and they know we can handle it
None

With the new ones, I doubt many will show up, but those who do, they'll see a normal house, I promise, he assured her.

None

Taking a deep breath, she nodded, trying to relax even more, that's what I want them to see; a normal house..
None

Even though it's not 'normal' to be a teen parent.

None

True, but I think we're doing a damn good job at parenting a baby as teenagers, he commented honestly.

None

We are, she agreed, but we're also lucky to have amazing support from our families and friends
None

Unfortunately not all teens who end up as parents get that.

None

Puck shrugged, yeah, I know, but I don't think about them or try to compare us to anyone else; we're a family and doing a great job
None

That is what matters.

None

Rachel smiled, taking in what he said, you're right
None

We are definitely doing a great job and I'm so happy with our lives.

None

Nodding in agreement, Puck pressed a kiss her lips, I definitely am, too.

None

After updating this, and then my other 3 WIPs, I expected to return to this one, but I got an idea for one of my non-posted WIPs (will be posted soon, though) and I wanted to work on it for a while

The next thing I know most of November had past
None

Then I began planning out the next few chapters of 'Starlight', because it had research I needed to do and on Thanksgiving, I found out 'Starlight' had been stolen and someone was rewriting it and posting it under a new name: See 'Starlight - Chapter 41' for the whole story, but the person was reported and the fic was taken down
None

It pissed me off! Wanting to let my readers know what happened, I chose to update that one next, so as soon as I got it posted, I got right into working on this one and here's the update

I am working as fast as I can, but with the holiday season here, I have other things gong on, too

There will be bits and pieces here and there, but I really am ready to get closer to graduation and their future

Though some of the future of this fic is definitely fictional or not quite possible the way I have it planned, you guys will love it, I promise! Please stick with me! I know a lot of you may not like the Navy part of the fic or that Rachel is staying in Lima, but it's always been the plan and direction: Puck would join the Navy and Rachel and Abby would stay in Lima

This is my first fic and I'm going with my original plan

I know Rachel staying in Lima is an issue, but at the time I made that plan, I had my reasons and I'm sticking with them; you guys won't be disappointed in this fic, I promise! I really appreciate all of you who have stuck with me and I hope you continue on.

Monday morning, though Puck wanted to sleep in, he and Rachel were both awake by seven and neither got to stay in bed too long; they had things to do that day
None

Their fellow Glee members would be over to discuss songs for Regionals, since they couldn't at school because of the snow days and the sooner they decided on songs, the more time they'd have to get ready for the competition.

None

With Abby still asleep, since she usually slept until about eight, Puck and Rachel first took care of getting themselves ready for the day and then had breakfast, before they got to work
None

Taking all the dinning room chairs into the living room, along with the ones from the table in the kitchen, the two organized and picked up the living room, giving everyone plenty of places to sit.

None

Rachel knew that at least the original members of the club, along with Jessica and her boyfriend TJ, Ryan, Mandy and Travis would be there
None

It had been short notice when Rachel invited them over because of the holiday break, but she had heard from one of the new girls, Kris, who asked for directions and said she and her sister, Andi, and her sister's friend, Mel, would be there since they were all members
None

In addition to the teens, Will, Deborah and Brad, the directors would be there, only missing Ethan, since he had to work, but he'd be checking in throughout the day.

None

Since her sleep schedule had been a little off, Abby slept until about nine, which gave her parents a chance to organize and mostly clean up the house mostly
None

While Rachel was getting her changed and dressed, Deborah and Arin came over, having only just gotten up themselves, because Deborah wanted to talk to Rachel and Puck before they went shopping
None

While talking, Rachel decided she should go along, and since Arin didn't want to go, she stayed at the house with Puck, Abby and Kona.

['stay', 'with', 'puck']

A little after ten, Quinn, Finn and Kurt came over, wanting to hang out for a while before everyone else arrived
None

No offense, but you and your dad are spending a lot of time at the Hudson's, Puck commented, looking at Kurt as they sat around in the living room, watching Abby crawl around on one of her blankets and play with a few toys.

toy has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'toy']

None taken, Kurt assured him, and yeah, we are, he shrugged, I kind of like it
None

It's nice to be back and forth, actually
None

Kind of like when you were spending a lot of your time at Rachel's, he added.

None

Puck nodded, very true.

None

Quinn laughed, I've told them they'll be step-brothers one day, but they don't believe me.

None

You might be, Puck replied, nodding in agreement, they're spending nights together and you guys are moving back and forth..
None

If not officially, you could be living together soon, he told them.

None

Kurt and Finn exchanged glances and then looked at Puck and Quinn, do you guys really think it's that serious? Finn asked.

None

I don't know
None

You guys know your parents more than we do, but from what I know about their relationship, this is the first one they've had since the passing of their former spouses and I don't think mom would stay with someone that long, spend nights with him or have him and his son spend nights at your place if things weren't serious, Puck told them.

someone has no Synonyms in the API
['stay', 'with', 'someone']

When you put it like that, it does make sense, Kurt agreed, I haven't seen my dad this happy in a long time
None

I also know that their house, he motioned to Finn, is a lot bigger than mine and dad's, so that's why I stay at their place, but Finn and Quinn usually don't stay at ours
None

I guess it wouldn't be bad if we lived together, but it still would take some getting used to.

None

Finn nodded, yeah
None

I guess it wouldn't be any different than when you guys stay for a few nights at our place, but it'd be permanent, he shrugged
None

I don't know, I guess it's just weird to think that at eighteen my mom's gonna get remarried, but she does seem happy.

None

Puck looked around a little and laughed lightly, tell me about it
None

That's the last thing I thought would happen to my mom, but I'm glad she and dad got remarried; she's happy.

None

Burt hasn't proposed yet, so it might not happen, either, but I just mention it sometimes so you can think about it, because Burt probably wouldn't do that unless you were both alright with it, Quinn added.

None

I get what you mean, Finn nodded, sitting back on the couch, I guess we'll see.

None

The other teens in the room nodded, letting the conversation settle and Puck moved to sit in front of the tree to keep Abby from heading that way while she was crawling around.

None

I didn't think you would put a Christmas tree up, Kurt commented, you guys are Jewish.

None

Yeah, we are, but we want Abby to experience both holidays, like Rachel and I did when we were kids
None

Mom and dad bought a new tree for their place, so we decided to put this one up to have our first family tree
None

We're going to decorate it in a few days, Puck explained, motioning behind him.

None

That's a cool idea and time for more presents, Finn smirked.

None

Puck laughed a little, we did most of our present exchanging at Hanukkah, but yeah, we'll still exchange some
None

When Rachel and I decided to put this up, dad mentioned it's the perfect time for us to start making our own traditions and he's right
None

We're doing the actual holiday stuff at my parent's house, you know? Dinner and presents, but we still want our own tree, decorated with things we had up on our family trees growing up
thing has no Synonyms in the API
['decorate', 'with', 'thing']

Maybe one day we'll host Christmas here, but right now I'm totally cool with it just being the tree and some decorations, he admitted, and like Rachel said, the holiday season is about being with family and friends.

It definitely is, Kurt agreed.

None

Before anyone could respond, Kona began barking at a noise outside, which startled Abby and made her start crying
None

Puck slid closer to where she was sitting, rattle still in her hand and picked her up, it's okay, kiddo, Kona just hears mom and grandma outside, he murmured, holding her close and gently rubbing her back
None

Kona stopped barking when she saw Rachel and Deborah and as they walked in, both Abby and Puck turned to look at the door, see, mommy's home, he grinned, kissing her cheek, nothing to cry about, he assured her, her emotions changing quickly when she saw Rachel.

None

What's wrong? Rachel asked, hearing what Puck was saying.

None

Kona's barking scared her, Puck replied, but now that she sees you're home, she's alright, he replied.

None

Setting her bags down out of the way, she waved at their friends and moved over to Puck, reaching to take Abby from her dad, hey sweetheart
None

I missed you, she murmured, pressing a kiss to her cheek and holding her close, everything's alright
None

Nothing to get scared about; Kona is just protecting her family, she told her.

None

Puck smiled and stood up, pressing a kiss to his girlfriend's lips, hang out here
None

I'll help mom with the groceries.

grocery has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'mom', 'with', 'grocery']

Thanks, she returned his smile
None

Mom and I didn't bring in the bottles of water and cans of sodas, so you could do that, she added.

None

Sounds good, he nodded, Finn, you mind helping?

None

Nope, Finn shook his head and got up, following Puck outside.

None

Rachel kissed Abby, daddy will be back, she told her softly, taking a moment to focus on her daughter before turning her attention to Kurt and Quinn, since Arin had gotten up to take the groceries into the kitchen, hey
None

I didn't think you'd be here this early.

None

We thought we'd come over and hang out before everyone showed up
None

Also wanted to see if you needed any help with preparations, Quinn explained.

None

Oh, okay, that's cool, she smiled, I don't think there's too much preparation
None

We picked up some snacks, chips and drinks
None

We'll order pizza once everyone gets here, since we don't know what everyone will want or like on theirs and have it delivered, she explained, so we've got plenty of time to hang out.

None

Has anyone really thought of songs? Kurt asked curiously.

None

Honestly, Rachel shook her head, I've had a few ideas or suggestions, but specific ones, no
None

We've had other things going on, so we've got a lot of work to do.

None

Quinn nodded, yeah, same here
None

We may be here a while.

None

...

None

When all the groceries were put away, the kids and Deborah sat back and relaxed for a little while, and around eleven, Ben, Susan, Hannah, Jessica and TJ showed up and joined those who were already there
None

As time ticked closer to their scheduled time, more of the Gleeks arrived and by noon, all of the original members were there, along with TJ, Ryan, Mandy, Travis, Kris, Andi, Mel and Will, giving them three out of four directors and nineteen members, a large enough majority to come up with and agree on songs for Regionals.

None

Since Abby was normally had her nap at noon, while Deborah was taking pizza suggestions, Rachel got Abby down in her crib and returned downstairs and joined everyone
None

Once they all had drinks and found places to sit, they got down to business, knowing it may be a long process to figure out music.

None

Will had brought along the list the club had come up with the previous Monday at school, the songs everyone had liked, but not enough of them could really make a solid choice on any of them, which brings them to the reason for the 'emergency' meeting over break.

monday has no Synonyms in the API
None

Starting with the list they had, everyone gave Will suggestions to add to it and after a bunch more were added, pizza arrived, so they took a quick break to get lunch and then returned to their seats to get back to work
list has no Synonyms in the API
None

With a list of about sixty songs now, they definitely had a lot of work to do, so they started by going through the list and people gave reasons why they shouldn't use a song, including too much work for vocals, intricate band music or no sheet music available; Will had his laptop with him, checking the website he purchased music at to see what was there.

reason has no Synonyms in the API
None

With the list finally down to under forty, they were getting close, but time was ticking by
None

Knowing they needed at least one ballad, they focused on that one first and by two-thirty, they'd settled on a ballad and everyone nominated Puck and Rachel to sing it, since it was a love song
None

The two agreed and were glad to at least have one song chosen, even if it took almost three hours.

None

Abby woke up about three and while the group continued to talk, Puck went up to take care of her and they came downstairs a little bit later
None

Puck retook his seat next to Rachel and Abby was curiously looking around the room at all the faces, but stayed snuggled to her dad, a little shy and not fully awake.

None

Refocusing on what they were doing and trying not to get too sidetracked, by the time Ethan got over there around four, a Rachel and Quinn duet had been chosen; the two girls thought it would be fun, because they hadn't really done one together and everyone was okay with their choice and were close to being done.

choice has no Synonyms in the API
None

Because of their limited time and being a mom, Rachel was concerned about practicing
None

She knew she and her boyfriend could work on their duet anytime, and the same with Quinn, but she suggested that others take the leads on the other song.

None

Agreeing with Rachel, Will looked for more volunteers and Kurt and Tina stepped up
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

Liking the combination, the two each picked a few songs they'd like to sing, of the ones on the list, and having one in common, they looked to the others and when almost everyone agreed on it, a sigh of relief echoed around the room as they finally had their three competition songs.

None

It was now close to five and darkness began to settle over the town
None

Most of the guests thanked Rachel and Puck for having the meeting at their house and then said 'goodbye' before leaving, the group quickly being cut down by half.

None

When David and Alan arrived around five-thirty, the 'usual' people were still there, all of the Puckermans, TJ, Finn, Quinn, Kurt, and Ryan
None

Though Kurt had come over that morning with Quinn and Finn, Ryan invited him out to dinner and to hang out afterward, so they left just after Alan and David got there.

quinn has no Synonyms in the API
None

Sticking around to help clean up, Finn and Quinn returned to the Hudson's home, Rachel insisting they take some of the pizza with him, because they had a lot left over with toppings the family didn't eat
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
topping has no Synonyms in the API
['leave', 'with', 'topping']

Just after they left, TJ, along with Ben, Susan and their daughters went back to their place, leaving the close Puckerman and Berry family.

None

Snacking on leftovers from the day for dinner, the family sat around and talked, discussing going to David and Alan's house the next day to decorate
None

The guys were taking a half day off work and would be there around one, but Rachel assured them she, Noah and probably Deborah, Arin, Quinn and Finn would be over there before then
None

They didn't mind that and by eight, everyone headed home, giving Rachel and Puck some time with Abby, before they got her ready for bed and laid her down.

abby has no Synonyms in the API

...

None

Wow, what a day, Rachel sighed, finally crawling into bed around ten.

None

Puck nodded, yeah, tell me about it
None

I really didn't think it'd take almost five full hours to pick three songs, he admitted, joining her, but I'm glad it's done with
None

Now we can focus on our break and worry about that next year, he added, slipping his arms around her.

None

But Noah, we should...

None

No, he shook his head, I know what you're going to say and I'm saying 'no'
None

I want to spend my last high school winter break with my family
family has no Synonyms in the API
['break', 'with', 'family']

It's bad enough we've got homework to do, he told her, I love you, but please, don't say we should practice.

None

Thinking about what he said, Rachel noticed there seemed to be more to what he was getting at, especially the way he said 'high school winter break'
None

Um, alright
None

I won't
None

Why do I get the feeling that you mean, what you said, differently than what I think you did.

None

Letting his eyes drift closed, Puck gathered his thoughts, sighing, getting time off for the holidays are slim to none for the first few years of being in the Navy, he whispered, it's another reason why I want us to celebrate both Christmas and Hanukkah, he admitted sadly
None

I'll be the low man on the totem pole and others above me will get the luxury first
None

It also depends on exactly what I'm doing for a job, where I am and what day the holiday falls on, too
None

That's what my recruiter and I talked about the last time I saw him
None

He kind of warned me and thought I should let my family know, he paused, tugging the blankets up over them, I know I should have talked to you about it then, but I was going to wait until after the holidays, so we could just enjoy them, then talk after the new year, but when Quinn, Finn and Kurt mentioned they were surprised we put up a Christmas tree, I started thinking about this and I haven't been able to shake it.

None

Rachel leaned in and pressed a kiss to his lips, I know, she said softly, about missing holidays
None

I've been to many military family support forums and that was one of the biggest gripes they had, she slid closer and hugged him, I hate that you may miss one, but I get why
None

It's one of the reasons why I want to celebrate both, too
None

If you miss one, we've got the other, but we'll figure something, Noah
None

We'll be together for the holidays somehow.

None

Puck sighed in relief, glad she understood, even if the situation sucked, I love you so much, he murmured, I know we'll figure something out, too
None

I'm just really glad you get it
None

I've been worried about how I could bring it up because I know it's an upsetting topic.

None

Oh trust me, I've been preparing for almost a year, she assured him, as soon as it came up and you started talking serious about joining the Navy, I was looking things up about having a family with a military spouse, she told him honestly
spouse has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'family', 'with', 'spouse']

I know it's going to be rough and I don't like that we'll be apart, but thankfully we have technology that gives us a lot more connection than even five years ago did, so we'll work through this
None

It will be hard, but we'll make it, she told him honestly.

None

We will, he nodded in agreement and held her close, I love you so much.

None

I love you, too, Noah, she smiled, kissing him again, you're right, we should just enjoy our last winter break before you join the military
None

I can't wait to see you in a sailor's uniform, she added with a wink.

wink has no Synonyms in the API
['add', 'with', 'wink']

Puck smirked, oh really?

None

I can't help thinking about it
None

I've seen pictures of guys wearing them and just imagining what you'd look like in one, she blushed, I think you're going to look amazingly handsome.

None

Amazingly handsome? Puck smiled, holding her close, that's a new one
None

Hopefully reality is just as awesome as your imagination.

None

Rachel pressed a kiss to her lips, I'm sure it will be
None

You're always handsome to me.

None

...

None

Because of the year before, Finn and Quinn had become part of the Berry family and David and Alan wanted the two teens to join them in decorating and celebrating the holiday
None

They had already agreed to help out, but hadn't stayed long enough the night before to find out the 'when' details, other than knowing the next day, so when Puck and Rachel got up they messaged their friends to let them know the time.

None

Though David, Alan and Ethan would be taking a half-day off and not getting home until after noon, Rachel, Puck, Abby, Deborah, Arin, Quinn and Finn, headed over to the Berry's home around ten in the morning to get an early start.

None

The two men had put up their artificial Christmas tree in the living room where they wanted it and boxes of decorations had been set around the living room, so once they arrived, they started sorting and putting some things up, not wanting to wait until the guys got there.

None

This feels right, Quinn commented after a while, sitting in the living room helping sort out decorations from ornaments and other items.

None

What do you mean? Rachel asked curiously.

None

My parents and I always went to my sister's place in Columbus for the holiday, so we never decorated here
None

Last year was the first Christmas that felt like I was a part of the family and this year feels the same
None

Like, even though I'm not biologically related to you all, I'm still part of your family and we're celebrating part of Christmas together
None

I know living arrangements have changed a little over the past year and we have our own families to be celebrating with, too, but I still feel like being here is a home, too, she explained.

None

Rachel smiled and moved to sit next to her, I know how you feel
None

You are part of the Berry family and always will be
None

I like to think after how close we got, we're like sisters, so I'd hope you feel like family here, too.

None

I definitely feel like we're sisters, Quinn agreed, returning her smile
None

We've come a long way in a short time and I know I've said this before, but I really appreciate you guys taking me in like you did
None

I don't know what I would have done, but unfortunately I don't think I'll never be able to really repay you, she said honestly.

None

You don't have to, Rachel assured her, wrapping her arms around her in a tight hug, that's what friends and family do for each other, she smiled, and if we had to do it all over again, we would.

None

Quinn accepted her hug and nodded, thanks
None

I'm really glad things worked out the way they did.

None

We are, too, Puck agreed from across the room, where he was going through Christmas lights for outside
None

And the holidays are supposed to be happy times, so let's not bring up all the not so happy stuff and focus on the fact that we're all healthy and we've got awesome family and friends to be around, he suggested.

None

...

None

Agreeing with Puck's words, the girls let their conversation settle and everyone returned to what they had been doing
word has no Synonyms in the API
None

Abby was crawling around on the floor near Rachel and Quinn, checking out what they were doing, and came up to a large stuffed penguin wearing a blue scarf with silvery snowflakes on it and a matching hat
None

Seeing the animal, she first stopped and looked at it and then reached out to touch it, giggling when she felt the fur.

None

Abby's giggle caught everyone's attention and Rachel jumped up to get her camera, wanting to catch the moment and managed to get a few pictures of her crawling closer to it and wrapping her arms around the animal, greeting her new friend.

None

I think we may need to bring Mr
None

Penguin home with us, Puck commented with a grin, watching Abby snuggle into it's soft body.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel nodded, that's definitely a good idea
None

My grandma gave him to me several years ago and we kept him with the holiday decorations because of his hat and scarf
decoration has no Synonyms in the API
['keep', '-PRON-', 'with', 'decoration']

He was one of those holiday toys that was made specific for the year she got it.

None

She's a sucker for stuffed animals, and I know if we tried to take him away from her she'd cry, so I'm just saying now, it comes home with us, he smirked.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Wow, Puck's a big softie for his daughter, Finn grinned, trying to tease his friend a little.

None

Of course I am
None

She's daddy's little girl, Puck smiled, knowing Finn's tone was to tease, but he didn't care; he'd spoil his girlfriend and daughter as much as he could and wouldn't hide it
None

I want my girls happy, he added, moving to take a seat on the floor next to Abby and the penguin, lifting one of it's wings and teasing her nose with it.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

At her giggling, Rachel smiled and took another picture, before getting up and sliding into his lap, I can tell you that we are definitely happy, she assured him.

None

Puck grinned and kissed her, enjoying the family moment, good
None

I'm glad.

None

...

None

Getting back to work after a few moments, it wasn't long before Alan, David and Ethan were arriving after their half day of work
None

Having a simple lunch, they got back to decorating and the guys turned their attention to the lights outside.

None

Deborah had started dinner while they were outside and the girls decorated the living room, kitchen, dinning room and other rooms the guests would be in during the party and also added the lights to the tree.

None

When the guys came inside from putting up the lights, it was close to dinner time, so while Rachel fed Abby, they warmed up a little with hot chocolate and coffee, before everyone sat down to eat.

chocolate has no Synonyms in the API
['warm', 'little', 'with', 'chocolate']

Talking lightly and relaxing together, they all enjoyed the family time and when dinner was over, like they had the other night, they put their focus on decorating the tree with ornaments
ornament has no Synonyms in the API
['decorate', 'tree', 'with', 'ornament']

As decorations were pulled out to use, Rachel picked through them, taking her ornaments and others she wanted on her, Puck and Abby's tree and used other ones to put up and in a few hours they had the tree finished, with Rachel having many set aside for the other tree.

ornament has no Synonyms in the API
['use', ['ornament'], 'to', 'put']

Thank you all for helping out decorating
None

I know with everything going on the past few weeks it's definitely been the last thing on our minds, but it's been a great day, David admitted, smiling at everyone.

None

It's always fun, Rachel grinned, holding Abby on her lap with the penguin next to her.

penguin has no Synonyms in the API
['hold', 'abby', 'with', 'penguin']

Yeah, and we weren't freaking out like last year because it started snowing, Puck added, sitting next to his girlfriend with his arm around her shoulders.

['sit', 'with', 'arm']

And I wasn't miserable being pregnant, Quinn added, then blushed, sorry Deborah.

None

Deborah laughed lightly, it's alright, Quinn.

None

Decorating next year is going to be different though, Alan said softly.

None

What do you mean? Rachel asked, looking at him and David.

None

The two men exchanged glances with each other and then looked around, we've got something we want to tell you guys, David admitted.

None

Rachel, Quinn, you know you'll always have a place in our home, Alan started, but David and I have decided that it's time for us to move.

None

What? Rachel exclaimed, her tone raising an octave.

None

Rachel's outburst started Abby, so Puck reached over and pulled their daughter into his arms to calm her down, letting the Berrys talk for a moment.

None

We always knew when you moved out, we'd downsize at some point
None

This house is way too big for us
None

Now that you've got your own home and we're hardly here, it's just not sensible for us to live in such a large home, David explained, we're not leaving Lima; we're just going to get a smaller place, he added, wanting it to be clear they were not leaving town.

None

Learning that they were staying in Lima, Rachel relaxed a little, but her eyes still filled with tears at the news, but what about all my stuff? My room? All the memories we have here?

tear has no Synonyms in the API
['fill', 'with', 'tear']

You will always have a bedroom at our place, no matter where we live, Quinn, the same goes for you, Alan said honestly, and yes this place does have a lot of memories, but we'll be able to make new ones in another place
None

We know this is hard news and we're sorry to drop it on you after a great day like today, but we've finally made the decision and by the first of the year we'll be putting bids in on a few places we're interested in.

None

David got up and moved to sit next to Rachel, wrapping his arms around her tightly to comfort her, knowing she'd take it the hardest.

None

Rachel leaned against him and tried to relax, completely understanding their logical reasons for wanting a smaller place, I..
None

I know, she cried, and you're right and I get it, but it's just..
None

It's just so hard to think about leaving this place..
None

I've got so many good memories here and I won't have a physical reminder of them.

None

We know and we feel the same way
None

Nothing is going to change overnight and you'll always have your memories; those aren't going to go away with the move
move has no Synonyms in the API

And besides, home is where your heart is; your heart is with Noah and Abby, David told her honestly, and yes, we know you love us, but where we live doesn't change that.

Taking a deep breath she nodded, I know and I'm sorry for getting all emotional, but it's just so sudden and nothing I even expected, she paused, pulling back from him a little, I get it, I do..
None

It's just a lot to take in.

None

Puck reached out and rested his hand on her shoulder, I'm here, babe
None

We all are.

None

Turning to look at him, she smiled, taking his hand in hers, I know
None

Thanks, she smiled, so, um, where are you going to move? I mean, you said you're staying here, but what part of town?

None

Well, we're not making any promises, but we have found a place within walking distance of where you guys live, Alan commented.

None

Really? Rachel asked, calming down a little when she realized their place could be even closer than it already was.

None

You know the new homes where Ben and Susan moved to? David asked, and when she and the others nodded, he continued, well, there's a few homes that hadn't been completed when they bought theirs, and we're looking at one of them on the street; you actually walk or drive past it every day when you go drop Abby off, he explained
None

We're not the only people looking at it and as soon as it's open to bid on, we're going to put one in on it, but like dad said, we're not making any promises because it might not go to us.

None

But there's still a chance, right? Rachel wondered hopeful.

None

Oh yes, there is, Alan nodded, but we just don't want you to get your hopes up and then find out we don't get it
None

It's definitely what we're looking for and we'll be in the office the day we can bid on it, so hopefully our offer will be accepted, but if it isn't, then we'll have to keep looking or fall back on some other choices.

None

Rachel nodded, biting her lip, and those are where?

None

Further away, David said, but let's not worry about those right now
None

We're hopeful that we'll get the one near you, but we do have back-up options, just in case.

None

Taking a deep breath, she nodded, well, then, I'll hope for the best, because it'd be really awesome if you guys lived closer, she said, settling from her emotions to hope they'd get the place.

None

Yeah, it would be, Alan and David agreed.

None

...

None

Though David and Alan's announcement was shocking to Rachel, Quinn, who was like another daughter to them, was okay with it; appreciating they'd still give her a place to stay if she needed it and assured them she understood their reasons for wanting to move.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

As much as Rachel didn't want to leave right away, it was getting late and they had to take care of Abby and check on Kona, since she'd been home alone all day, except for the brief time Ethan had gone to let her out and check on her for them, so they started to gather things up to get ready to go.

None

The guys helped put the storage boxes away and Puck took the box of stuff Rachel wanted, out to their car, and others helped make sure the house was cleaned up and presentable, talking about plans for a few days later, when they were having the actual party.

None

Quinn and Finn were the first ones to say 'goodnight' and then Deborah, Ethan and Arin left, leaving Rachel, Abby and Puck
None

The three only stuck around a short time longer, Rachel assuring her dads she was fine and was still upset, but was hopeful they could be closer, so it was helping her keep positive about the move.

None

When the young family finally headed home, Rachel was emotionally drained and wanted to get to bed, so she and Puck took care of Kona and Abby and once Abby was settled into her crib, Rachel crashed in bed
None

Puck didn't blame her; he understood major news like that was hard to take, plus they'd had a long day, so he settled just be close to her and there if she needed him.

None

...

None

Waking up the next morning, Rachel was surprised to find herself in bed just after eight
None

Wow, I was out of it last night, she mumbled rolling onto her back.

None

Yeah, you were, Puck agreed, sitting in bed with Abby on his chest, you alright, though?

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yes, she nodded, I think it was just the emotions really hit me and drained the rest of my energy, she admitted, sitting up a little to press a kiss to his lips and then Abby's forehead, morning.

None

Morning, Puck replied, shifting closer, you want to talk about the news? He wondered, unsure if she would be ready.

None

There isn't much to talk about
None

Dad and daddy let us know they were looking for a smaller place
None

I understand their reasons completely
None

I mean, they're not the only parents who decide to downsize when their only or last child leaves home, she explained, but it's upsetting with all the memories I made there, especially since you and I got together, but daddy's right, I'll always have the memories and my home is with you and Abby now.

memory has no Synonyms in the API
['upset', 'with', 'memory']

Puck smiled, kissing her forehead, I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel the same, handing Abby to her.

None

Rachel took their daughter and kissed her cheek, then snuggled closer to him, good to know and thanks, Noah
None

For understanding and being there for me, not just for last night, but for anything.

None

No problem, babe
None

I'll always be here for you, he promised, kissing her gently as he wrapped his arms around his family
None

So, what's on the schedule for today?

None

I don't know, she admitted, did your mom mention something about dessert on Christmas Day with the Hudsons, Hummels and Jessica's family?

None

You really were out of it last night, he smirked, then sobered to continue, yes, she did
None

She said she was going to talk to Carole and see what she thought about doing an extended family dessert party after Christmas dinner and even though my aunt, uncle and their family doesn't celebrate Christmas at all, they still could come over, too
None

You mentioned there was some baking you wanted to do and she was going to let us know soon about plans.

None

Oh yes, Rachel nodded, I do want to make some sugar cookies and a few other things
None

I need to go to the store and get some ingredients
None

I suppose it wouldn't hurt to go out and finish Christmas shopping and get some additional decorations, and a few new ornaments for us as a family to put on our tree, then this afternoon we can decorate and I can get going on baking either tonight or on Christmas Eve, she explained.

None

I can help, too, Puck told her, remember the cupcakes? He asked curiously.

None

Rachel smiled, yeah, I do
None

The help will definitely be appreciated and will be fun to do together, she told him, so shopping?

None

Yep, he agreed, why don't you hang with Abby and I'll go shower
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Then when I'm done, I'll take care of her and Kona while you get ready
None

We can have breakfast when you're done and then figure out where we want to go and all that, he suggested.

None

Okay, sounds good, she nodded, kissing him gently
None

Love you, she added with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Returning her kiss and smile, he hugged them, I love you, both, too.

None

...

None

Taking a quick shower, it wasn't long before Puck and Abby were heading downstairs, so Rachel could get ready for the day
None

Letting Kona outside and feeding Abby, by the time Rachel joined them, Abby was fed and they put her in her playpen while they had breakfast
None

Over their meal, Rachel wrote a shopping list and after eating, they got Abby ready and soon the family was heading out to the store
None

David and Alan's party was mostly a potluck, but Rachel always made some dips and dishes, so while picking up items to make cookies, she also go the ingredients for some of the things she usually made.

None

On top of getting ingredients and things for the next few days, they also finished their Christmas shopping and picked up a few new ornaments for their tree, things that meant something to them as a family or a couple, making sure to get a 'Baby's First Christmas' ornament for Abby.

None

Returning home around two, they put their things away and after having a late lunch and getting Abby down for a nap, the two sat back in the living room to relax
None

Would you like to start decorating? Rachel asked after a few moments.

None

Sure, Puck nodded, it's probably a great time, since Abby is down for her nap.

None

That's what I was thinking
None

I still want to have her with us for a little bit of it, but she can't do too much, she added.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Exactly, Puck replied, kissing Rachel's cheek.

None

...

None

They weren't decorating as much as at their parents' homes, so it didn't take too long to lay some garlands and a few cute decorations around, before they got into working on the tree
None

Picking out strands of colored lights, they started wrapping them around the tree, and when they were content with the amount, they sat down with their ornaments and began going through them.

ornament has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'ornament']

At first, they put up the ornaments they'd just gotten, ones geared towards their current events; their first as a family, Abby's first Christmas and a few 'couple' ones, along with some other ones that meant something to them together.

None

Abby woke up at that time, so they took a brief break to get her changed and taken care of and then the family returned to what Puck and Rachel had been doing.

None

The two started going through each ornament they'd brought over from their parents' homes and while putting some up, they'd explain the reasons for them
None

A lot of their ornaments were ones they'd gotten in their favorite characters from movies or cartoons, along with things they'd been in during school, like Puck had football and basketball ones, and Rachel had dance and music ones, but together, the ornaments made the tree theirs.

None

They'd set Abby in between them, so they didn't have to hold her and she was content to sit there with her new penguin, so it gave Puck and Rachel a chance to continue what they'd bee doing
penguin has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'penguin']

When they finished, Rachel got out her camera and took a few pictures, then got Abby to sit in front of it, with her penguin and Kona joined her and Rachel took a few pictures with them in front of it.

penguin has no Synonyms in the API
['get', 'with', 'penguin']

We should have mom or dad come over and take one of all of us in front of it, Puck commented, taking a picture of them with his phone.

phone has no Synonyms in the API
['take', 'picture', 'with', 'phone']

That's a great idea, Rachel smiled, would you call?

None

I'll text, he replied, sending his parents a message asking if one of them could come over to take a picture of them.

None

It was close to dinner time and Deborah was in the middle of cooking, so Ethan came over and when they explained what they wanted, he gladly took a few pictures with her camera and their phones, his included
camera has no Synonyms in the API
['take', 'picture', 'with', 'camera']

Rachel really liked the picture when she looked at it and thanked him for taking it; she decided to post it on her Facebook page for their families to see, since she'd also posted one of them during Hanukkah.

None

Ethan hung out for a few minutes, but headed home; it was the one of the few nights that week that the families decided to have dinner apart, because the next three, at least, they'd be together for the holiday.

None

I guess we should think about dinner, too, Rachel admitted, realizing it was five-thirty and they hadn't started it.

None

I'll get dinner tonight, babe
None

You just hang out with Abby and Kona, Puck told her, you've got baking to do and are helping out with your dads' party tomorrow, so I got this.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
party has no Synonyms in the API

...

None

Thankful for the help, Rachel got a chance to sit back and relax a little, knowing the next day would be hectic, but also fun because some of their friends would be there, just like the year before.

None

Realizing something, Rachel looked at Abby and saw she was content in her playpen, so she got up and headed into the kitchen, Noah, you know what I just realized? She asked.

None

Puck smirked, that you can't relax? He wondered.

None

Blushing lightly, she shook her head, no, not that, and I just thought of something and I wanted to tell you, she said seriously, do you know what tomorrow is?

None

Your dads' Christmas party? He asked, unsure what she was getting at.

None

Well, yes, but that's not what I was talking about
None

Do you remember what happened at their party last year on the same date?

None

Thinking for a moment, he tried to remember, did it start snowing? He asked, because I don't think there's any in the forecast, if that's what you're getting at.

None

No, that's not it, she replied, trying not to get frustrated, realizing that a lot had gone on in the past year to remember every detail, but she hoped he'd still remember that one.

None

My dad calling me? He asked and when she nodded, he returned her nod as he worked on dinner, I remember
None

That's not something I'd forget.

None

Alright
None

I just wasn't sure if you had
None

I just realized it myself, she told him, are you going to talk to him about it?

None

Of course, Puck replied with grin, it's the biggest moment in some ways, because if he hadn't called, some or most of this might not have happened, he motioned around, we'd obviously still have Abby and be together, but other things would be different, like mom and Arin would still live here and you, Abby and I might be living with your dads.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
dad has no Synonyms in the API

Really? She asked surprised at the last part, but understood the rest.

None

Puck nodded, yeah
None

It was something that had come up
None

We knew Abby couldn't be passed between our homes all the time, so one of us would have to move in with the other
other has no Synonyms in the API
None

If mom and Arin had stayed here and dad hadn't returned, I may have chosen to move in with you and your dads, he told her.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh, wow, I never thought of that, she admitted, moving towards him, I guess that did change things.

None

I'm glad they turned out the way they did, because now we have our own house, he replied, wrapping his arms around her
None

so I try not to think about the 'what ifs', he added.

None

Rachel nodded, I know
None

I'm glad we've got our own place, still shocked, but definitely glad, she smiled, pressing a kiss to his lips.

None

Returning her kiss, Puck glanced at the stove, babe, let me get dinner
None

You need to go kick back and relax
None

Big day tomorrow, he murmured, kissing her once more.

None

Blushing, but nodding, alright, I'll go
None

Thank you again for making dinner.

None

No thanks needed, he assured her, I'm happy to help out.

None

...

None

Giving in and relaxing, Rachel snuggled with Abby on the couch until dinner and fed her and Kona just before they ate, and Abby was content to stay in her high chair while they were eating
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

When dinner was over, Puck let Rachel help with dishes and soon the three of them were returning to the living room; sitting on the floor and letting Abby crawl around between them on a blanket.

dish has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'with', 'dish']

As it got later and knowing they had a big day the next day, they got Abby ready for bed and once she was down to sleep, Rachel and Puck headed to the kitchen to prep a little for the next day, deciding to take Christmas Eve to do the baking she wanted.

None

Getting to bed around ten, the two set their alarm for eight, knowing they had things to make and do the next morning and needed time to get ready and gather things up, to take over to her dads early so there was time to prepare for the late-afternoon start to the party.

None

When the morning arrived, Rachel began packing things up to take over and Puck took care of Abby and by eleven they were heading over to her dads' place
None

The rest of their family and friends would be over later in the day, so for a while it was just the few of them and by one, Quinn, Finn, Carole, Kurt, Ethan, Deborah and Arin arrived, pitching in where Rachel needed help to get things ready
None

Jessica, Ben, Susan and Hannah had also been invited and the family joined them, even though they didn't celebrate Christmas, just so they could spend time with their family and friends.

family has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'time', 'with', 'family']

By three in the afternoon, guests from David and Alan's offices, along with friends of the Berrys' slowly began to show up, filling the house
None

None of her dads' coworkers had met Rachel's daughter yet, but they did know that David and Alan were grandpas, so Abby was the center of attention once she woke up from her nap and Rachel enjoyed mingling with everyone to introduce her, happy that everyone seemed to be accepting of her choices.

everyone has no Synonyms in the API
None

The Berrys' party was always just a chance to mingle with coworkers and families without the burden of the office surrounding them, and with the holiday just a few days away, it was understandable that not everyone could attend, and those who did make it, some didn't stay too long, having other things going on, but still wanted to make an appearance.

coworker has no Synonyms in the API
holiday has no Synonyms in the API
None

With a fun, relaxing, but uneventful party, by seven, most of the guests began to leave, until it was just the Puckermans, Berrys and their close family and friends.

None

Well, this was a better end to the party than last year, Puck commented, sitting down next to his dad.

None

Isn't that when Mr
None

Schuester told us about Sue leaving? Quinn asked.

None

Well, yeah that was that day, too, but now what I'm talking about, he replied, motioning to his dad, do you remember calling me?

None

Ethan smirked a little, yeah, I do
None

In a way it's the call that started it all, huh?

None

It was
None

I know at the time I was pissed, but I'm glad you called
None

Things might have been different if you hadn't, Puck told him.

None

Yeah, they might have, but I think we would have been in contact sometime after that if I hadn't called, actually
None

Your mom and I were still talking and I wanted to marry her again
None

Though I'm glad I called, because I was able to propose and meet with you all a lot sooner than I had first thought I would, Ethan admitted, if I had to do it again, I still would have called.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I know
None

I'm glad you and mom are back together and we're a family again
None

It sucks that you left at all, but I now know why you did leave, Puck paused and took a deep breath, and I don't know if I've ever actually told you this directly, but I've forgiven you.

None

Ethan smiled, I've been pretty sure you had, but it's nice to hear it for sure, he admitted, and it really means a lot to know
None

Thank you.

None

Puck nodded and returned his smile, no problem
None

I had hoped you knew, but still wanted to say something if I hadn't in the past and I thought tonight was a good time to bring it up.

None

It is, Ethan agreed, and it's nice to spend Christmas with my family
family has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'christmas', 'with', 'family']

Never thought I'd ever get to spend any of the holidays with you guys, so this is definitely a big deal for me.

['spend', 'any', 'with', 'guy']

We're glad you're here, too, Arin said, moving over to sit on his lap and gave him a hug.

None

Returning her hug, he kissed her cheek, the first of many holidays with you all.

None

Sounds like a great plan to me, Deborah agreed from where she was sitting next to him.

None

Me too, Puck replied, smiling at them, then glanced at Rachel who was on another couch, holding Abby, this is definitely a great time to spend with the family.

family has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'with', 'family']

...

None

Settled in with the family, though no one was ready to leave, Rachel and Puck decided to head home around nine to get Abby into bed and everyone else decided to leave at the same time
family has no Synonyms in the API
['settle', 'with', 'family']

Rachel's dads promised to be over around noon and would spend the next night at their house.

None

Arriving home, Kona was happy to see them
None

Aside from Puck going home to check on her around five, letting her out and feeding her, she'd been alone all afternoon, so after Rachel and Puck got Abby settled, they spent some time with Kona, before turning in themselves.

kona has no Synonyms in the API
None

Waking up on Christmas Eve morning, the young couple relaxed in bed as long as they could, then got up and did their usual morning activities, but this time, once breakfast was over, Rachel started baking
None

She had several things she wanted to make and had put off until that day.

None

Moving Abby's playpen closer to the kitchen, so she wasn't left alone, Puck joined Rachel and the two spent the rest of the morning mixing ingredients, and putting things into the oven to bake.

None

Now this is fun, Puck admitted, sitting down at the table in the kitchen, taking a break from what they'd been doing.

None

Rachel smiled, sliding into his lap and slipping her arms around his neck, it is
None

This is just another thing I love doing with you, she told him.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh really? He kissed her, as he wrapped his arms around her, I feel the same way, he agreed, and just what other things do you enjoy doing with me? He wondered curiously.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Shifting a little in his lap, she straddled his hips and leaned in, kissing him gently, that list is never ending, Noah
None

I love doing this with you, I love kissing you, I love singing with you, I love spending time with you, talking to you, she started, and so much more.

Puck tugged her closer and kissed her again, letting one hand trail up to run through her hair, I'm so lucky, he murmured, holding her close

None

I love being with you, holding you, knowing you want to be with me..

I love having a daughter with you, and I look forward to the day we can have more children together, he smiled brightly at her, you're so beautiful.

None

Rachel blushed, feeling tears in her eyes as he spoke and hugged him tightly, thank you, Noah
None

I feel the same way you do, too
None

I want to have more children with you, I just know that right now it's too much, but when we're out of school and Abby's a bit older, I'm sure we'll know when we'll be ready for another child, she explained.

None

Exactly
None

I totally agree
None

Besides, we've got our whole lives to have a bigger family, he added, reaching up and brushing his hand along her cheek, no crying
None

It's the holidays, he winked.

None

I know, but I just can't help it
None

I'm so happy, she replied, hugging him.

None

Me too, he agreed, kissing her cheek and holding her close, but their moment was interrupted when the oven timer went off, cookies are calling.

None

Rachel sighed, and I was comfortable, she murmured, sliding off his lap to move to the oven, checking on the cookies and taking the pans out.

None

Watching her bend over, Puck definitely enjoyed the view, but agreed he liked having her in his lap, I promise my lap is open for use anytime you want, he grinned, but I also enjoy this view, too.

None

Knowing what she meant, Rachel blushed, thank you.

None

You're welcome, he got up and moved to stand behind her, slipping his arms around her waist and resting his chin on her shoulder, it'd be even better if you were naked, he added with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Noah! Rachel gasped, her eyes widening as she turned around to stare at him in shock.

None

What? He slid his arms back around her and smiled brightly, babe, we have lived in this house for months, alone, except for a few nights a week when your dads stay over, he let his hands slip under her winter themed sweater to rest against her warm skin, there are 

None

 many places I wanna make love to you
None

I can think of five right now, and that's just here in the kitchen.

None

Rachel's mouth fell open, shock still evident on her face, but feeling his hands against her skin, caused sparks to ignite all over her body, but we have Abby..
None

And our parents come over a lot, she said, trying to resist, but finding it difficult.

None

They knock, most of the time, and if they did walk in on us, it'd be the last time they didn't knock, he winked, leaning down to press a kiss to her lips and then trailed his lips down her neck, don't tell me you haven't thought of christening 

None

 house.

None

As much as Rachel wanted to say she hadn't, she knew that would be a lie
None

She preferred to make love in their bed, but she couldn't deny that at times, she'd thought of doing it in other places around the house, especially knowing that it was theirs, okay, I admit I've thought about it, she agreed, now you sound more like Puck than you do my Noah, she added softly.

None

Well, Noah is allowed to have sexual thoughts about his girlfriend, right? He wondered, his arms slipping around her waist to gently lift her up so she was closer to eye level with him, and Puck and Noah are the same person.

None

Of course you're allowed to; I'm not denying that
None

And yes, physically they are the same person, but Noah is a big soft teddy bear and Puck is a badass tough guy and I don't see him as often as I did when we first started dating
None

In some ways, to put it in perspective, I think of Puck as 'sex' and Noah as 'making love', and, she blushed, I love our relationship, don't get me wrong, but I never got to experience just 'sex' with Puck and I want to.

puck has no Synonyms in the API

With one arm holding her, Puck used his other to move aside the few things on the counter behind her and then carefully set her down, his hands resting on her hips, I get what you're saying, babe, he started, resting his forehead against hers, but I've always been Noah to you, because I respect you; you're worth so much more to me than 'just sex' and that life is way in the past for me, he told her honestly, but, if you wanna have some fun, all you gotta do is ask, he added with a wink, letting one of his hands slip under her skirt to rest on her thigh.

Smiling, she reached out and wrapped her arms around his neck as she slid to the edge of the counter, I love you, Noah, and it means the world to me that you respect me and I know you'll always treat me right, she started, then looked at him, her smile turning into a devious grin, but I definitely wanna have fun with you, too, she finished, pressing a kiss to his lips.

Puck's entire body reacted to her words, causing him to groan into their kiss, as he held her
None

He was extremely happy that she knew of and was okay with his past, and he swore to himself that he would never push her into anything
past has no Synonyms in the API
None

He always wanted her to be the one to make the next move and did expect this conversation to come up one day, and now that it was out in the open, his mind filled with ideas, babe, that sounds like an amazing idea, but no matter what we do, or how we phrase it, I'll always be making love to you
idea has no Synonyms in the API
None

Whether it's a quickie against the counter or in our bed, it'll still be a special moment between us, but if you're ready, I'd be happy to show more, he said honestly, trying to calm down from the moment, knowing they didn't have time to get into anything because they'd have visitors at any time.

None

I never doubted that, she replied, kissing him gently, I think I wanted to bring it up to let you know I'd be willing to try
None

I just wanna be as close to you as I can be.

None

He nodded in understanding, me too, Rachel, and I promise we will be and I'd love to try out something now, but our families could be here any time and we're baking.

None

She blushed, I'm..
None

I'm sorry if I got you, um...

None

Puck pressed a kiss to her lips, don't be sorry
None

I'm fine, he assured her, helping her down from the counter and hugging her tightly.

None

Rachel relaxed in his arms for a long moment, before looking up, I suppose we should get this finished, she murmured, looking at the various things on the counter, including baking pans with cookies still on them.

cookie has no Synonyms in the API
['bake', 'pan', 'with', 'cookie']

Glancing around, he nodded, yeah, that's a good idea.

None

...

None

Though their conversation had been important, the two were glad it had ended, because about ten minutes later, her dads showed up, soon followed by his parents and sister.

None

The Berrys and Puckermans had talked the day before and agreed to have a movie day, like Puck and Rachel had done the year before on Christmas Eve
None

Everyone had brought over a few choice movies and Rachel and Puck had picked some from their collection and once they all had lunch and Abby went down for her nap, the family found seats in the living room and settled on the first movie.

None

The first movie Rachel had seen before, so she bounced between watching it and finishing up the cookies and then sat through the whole second movie
None

Around four, Abby woke up from her nap and the second movie had finished, so while Rachel took care of Abby, the others chipped into make dinner and when it was ready, they sat down to eat.

None

Once they were finished eating, they retook their seats and looked through the stacks of movies for another one to watch, oh we have to watch this! Rachel exclaimed, holding up the case for 'An Officer and a Gentleman'
None

We watched it last year, and afterward Noah first mentioned he'd thought of joining the Navy and now he is and it seems fitting, she admitted.

None

See, I told you she'd want to, Deborah said, nudging her husband with a grin on her face.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Ethan smirked, yeah, you were right.

None

But I'm not going to be an officer
None

Just enlisted
None

There's a difference, Puck replied, smirking at his girlfriend and parents.

None

It still involves the Navy
None

Can we? She asked her boyfriend hopeful.

None

It's fine with me
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I like the movie, but there's others that need to agree, Puck shrugged, if they don't mind, go for it, he added.

None

I'm fine with it, Ethan agreed.

None

We are, too, David nodded, we actually thought of bringing it over, too, but Alan reminded me that Deborah had it, so we didn't bring ours over, he commented with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel blushed and got up, moving to put the DVD in before returning to her spot next to her boyfriend on the couch, I think we should make this a tradition; to watch it every Christmas Eve, she suggested, her blush still tinting her cheeks.

None

I think that could be arranged, Deborah smiled, you guys know it's my favorite movie.

None

...

None

Curled up against her boyfriend, Rachel watched the movie and found she understood it more, not only because she'd seen it once before, but also because she knew more about the various aspects of military lives; learning from family forums online and also from things Puck talked about he learned from the book he needed to read.

None

Certain parts hit her just as hard as the first time, and both her and Deborah were in tears by the end, I promise I'll be at your boot camp graduation, she told her boyfriend softly as they hugged.

None

Puck smiled, I know you will be, babe
None

I never doubted that, he said honestly, kissing her gently, and maybe one day I'll be able to sweep you off your feet like he did, he added, holding her close to him.

None

That would be so romantic, she smiled, wiping her eyes, I didn't expect to start crying.

None

It's okay, you're allowed to get emotional, he assured her, glancing at Abby in her playpen, looks like someone else was watching, too, he added, motioning to how Abby was laid back on her stuffed penguin, with her attention in the direction of the TV, as if she had been watching the TV through the soft mesh of the playpen.

attention has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh, sweetie, Rachel grinned, moving to pick her up, were you watching the movie with us? She asked, kissing her cheek and settling her against her chest as she retook her seat next to Puck
None

Abby snuggled up to Rachel and her eyes closed, I think you might be tired, huh, little one?

None

Puck leaned over and pressed a kiss to Abby's cheek, I think you're right, he nodded, seeing the signs that she was sleepy
None

Definitely time for bed.

None

...

None

Taking a break from movies, Rachel and Puck got Abby ready for bed and once she was settled into her crib for the night, the two returned to their family
None

They decided to watch another movie and when it ended around eleven, Ethan, Deborah and Arin decided to go home and get some sleep
None

After agreeing to be over at their house the next morning around ten for brunch, the three left and then David and Alan headed up to Puck and Rachel's guest room for bed
None

Rachel and Puck stayed up a little longer, but once they had put some things away and closed up the house for the night, they went to bed themselves.

None

As with almost every day, Abby woke her parents just after eight, so they got up with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel took care of changing her diaper and feeding her, while Puck got showered and ready for the day and then he took care of getting Abby dressed, while Rachel got showered and dressed, finishing about the time her dads woke up
None

Once Alan and David were up and ready, they all gathered up the presents they'd wrapped in the past few weeks and around ten headed over to Deborah, Ethan and Arin's house, and this time Kona went with them.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Greeting everyone and setting the presents around the tree, the family sat down for brunch and once they'd finished, they gathered in the living room
None

Since they'd done a lot of gift exchanging at Hanukkah, the adults decided to just get gifts for the kids, so when they were settled onto a spot on the floor, their parents began passing out the presents.

None

Abby was sitting in Puck's lap at first, but then he settled her onto the floor so she could check things out, because she was drawn to the shiny bows, colorful wrapping paper and crinkly ribbon.

None

As Puck slid the curly mass of ribbon off one of his presents, he handed it to her, just don't eat it, he smirked
None

Taking the decoration from him, Abby shook it and giggled when it rustled in her hands and then crawled closer to him, do you want to help me open my presents? He asked with a laugh, seeing her grabbing at the paper.

laugh has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel grinned, she's going to love it when all the paper and stuff is on the floor, she admitted, handing over a silver bow that had been on her gift, but we just have to keep her from eating anything.

None

I know, Puck nodded, we'll watch her, he assured her, laughing when he saw Kona was rolling on her back on a pile of paper from Arin's package
None

Between Kona and Abby, this is gong to be an entertaining morning, he said honestly.

None

Yes it will be, Rachel agreed.

None

...

None

As Puck said, the unwrapping of presents was an adventure
None

Abby and Kona had experienced a little of opening presents on Hanukkah, but the gifts had been spaced out between eight days, where as Christmas was only one day, so the two were both enjoying the mass of paper, ribbon and bows piling up in the middle of the living room floor
None

Kona spent most of the time rolling around on the pile as it grew and Abby liked rustling everything she could find and really seemed intrigued with a larger, fluffier and shiny purple bow that had been on a package of Arin's.

bow has no Synonyms in the API
['intrigue', 'with', 'bow']

Abby, you have good taste in colors, Rachel commented, taking a pictures of her sitting in the middle of the wrapping paper, holding the bow
None

Reaching out to rustle the item, Abby giggled and started shaking the bow to make more noise.

None

Snapping a few more pictures, Rachel reluctantly gave up, knowing she and Deborah already had a ton of that morning, mostly of Abby and Kona playing in the wrapping paper and decorations
None

Picking up Abby and letting her keep the bow in her hand, Rachel moved them over to sit down on the couch next to Puck, now this is what the holidays are about
None

Having fun and enjoying the time with family, she said.

None

Puck nodded, yeah, that is very true, he agreed, kissing Abby, then Rachel, and just wait until Abby's older next year and she's able to do more
None

It'll be even more fun.

None

I don't even want to think about her being older
None

I mean, it feels like she was just born and now she's almost eight months old
None

Time is going to fly by so fast, Rachel sighed, and I know there's noting to stop it, so I'll just settle for making great memories.

None

Sounds like a great idea for me, Puck agreed, slipping an arm around her shoulders and holding her close to him, I love you.

None

Rachel smiled, settling against him, and pressing a kiss to his lips, I love you, too, Noah.

None

A/N3: I hope you guys enjoyed it! As I said at the end of the last chapter, there is going to be a lot of summary to progress the fic along, in hopes of getting closer to the summer in the story

Let me know what you guys think! This chapter is two parts on LJ because it was too long.

A/N4: I think I'm finally getting back on top of things so updates may be more frequent

I know I've said this before and I'm sorry, but I didn't intend for this update to be so far apart from the last one
None

I have not quit writing and I don't plan on it
None

I have just had a bunch of personal things going on that has keep me busy or distracted
None

The hardest one was having to put my three and a half year old dog to sleep
None

She got sick one day and after three trips to the vet in three days in early January, they couldn't figure out what was wrong with her and she kept getting worse
None

She didn't deserve the pain and suffering she was in, so we had to let her go
None

It was super tough to say goodbye and it has been pretty lonely around the house without her, but I, along with my parents, know that we did the right thing because she is no longer in pain, but it still hurts like hell.

None

A/N5: As I stated in my last update for 'Starlight', I've decided to try my hand at writing Lark (Lea/Mark) fics

As talked about prior to the holiday, after dinner on Christmas Day, the Hudsons, Quinn, the Hummels and Deborah's brother and his family all came over to Deborah and Ethan's house to continue celebrating with a small dessert party to enjoy some time with their friends and extended family.

Though it had just been a tease to Finn and Kurt earlier in the week about possibly becoming step-brothers soon, the reality came when Burt proposed to Carole in front of everyone that night and she said 'yes'
None

The couple admitted they'd talked about it for some time, but didn't want to rush things; they did see that in their future and wanted to live together permanently
None

Now that they were engaged, they announced that starting in the new year, Burt and Kurt would be moving into the Hudson's home
None

Kurt and Finn were shocked, but had also been preparing for it and even though Burt hadn't talked to them first, the two teens gave their parent's their blessing to get married.

None

Congratulations was passed around and when the question of a date and type of wedding came up, both agreed they didn't want anything fancy
None

They'd probably do something like what Deborah and Ethan had done
None

Signing papers at the court house and having a reception somewhere with close friends and family, because they had already done the big weddings when they'd had their first marriages and remembered the stress.

None

...

None

The week between Christmas and New Year's was spent organizing Rachel and Puck's garage
None

A lot of Ethan's stuff was still in it from his move, so all of his things were moved across the street to their garage for him to go through later
None

Deborah and Arin went through some of their things; some getting rid of, but a lot was moved into their garage, and Puck went through a few of his boxes, but most of his things, he just pushed aside to deal with at a later date.

None

By the end of the week, Ethan and Puck were taking measurements and starting on a design plan for the upgrade, wanting to take their time, but set a goal to start the actual work by Spring Break, after Nationals, which would give Rachel the studio space she needed and still gave them space for storage, a garage and a weight room.

None

Rachel was really looking forward to her space
None

The more she helped rearrange and sort things out, realizing why they were doing it, the more excited and serious she got about starting her photography business
None

She even took time to research just what she'd need to make her studio useful, without going overboard on things she might not need.

None

...

None

New Year's Eve fell on a Friday and even though they had been invited out, Rachel and Puck decided to stay home with Abby, so they could have their first one as a family
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

They also knew it could be their last one together for a while, so they wanted to be alone, unlike the year before when they spent it with their friends.

On New Year's Day, like they'd talked about, Rachel set up an area in the house to get photos of Abby at eight months, and their families also came over to help, making sure they got some pictures of Puck, Rachel and Kona with Abby, too
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

In looking at the photos on the computer just after, Rachel was happily surprised that her boyfriend had been right
None

Her photos had turned out just as good, if not better than the ones they'd had taken just after she was born and it made her even more excited to get started in the photography career.

None

The first Sunday of the year, January 2nd, Ethan and Puck had tickets to a hockey game in Detroit, so the father and son headed up north for the game and some father-son bonding, which they both enjoyed.

None

Returning to school on Monday, the Glee Club met and began preparations for their Regionals competition
None

They decided to focus on the music and choreography first and closer to the competition they'd figure out what they'd want to wear for costumes.

None

Everyone was thrown off by having missed the last few days of school before Winter Break, so students and teachers were playing catch-up, but by the end of the week things seemed to be back to normal
None

Friday night, the basketball team had their first game of the year at McKinley and David and Alan watched Abby so Rachel could go cheer on her boyfriend, congratulating him with a hug on the court when the buzzer went off and McKinley had won.

hug has no Synonyms in the API

During the first week of the new year, David and Alan put a bid in on the house they wanted near the Puckerman's homes, hoping to get it, but knew they had other people wanting it, too
None

Knowing it could take a few weeks to find out if they did get it, they were hopeful that both of them having stable, good paying jobs would be a key to getting it.

None

On top of them moving, Carole, Finn and Quinn began to get the Hudson's home ready for Burt and Kurt to move in and the Hummels were starting to pack up for their move and eventually selling their house; Kurt wasn't attached to the house like Finn and Puck were to their homes.

None

Along with all the moving, Rachel, Puck and Ethan continued plans for the rebuild of the garage, wanting it complete it before Puck graduates, so they knew they had about six months left.

None

...

None

Over the past few months, Abby had been extra talkative, in baby talk
None

Babbling and saying sounds, but nothing ever clear enough to be words
None

They continued to encourage her to say 'mama' and 'dada' two of the common first words and Deborah assured them she'd start talking when she was ready, so they settled to wait, but were excited to hear them.

None

Abby had also been active in trying to hug people, not just snuggling up to to them like she had when she was a baby
None

She actually attempted to wrap her arms around someone's neck when they were holding her, even if her arms were too short to reach
None

Everyone loved it and thought she was cute, and Rachel made sure to get pictures of cute moments with her and their family and friends.

She'd also learned how to wave; something they'd been trying to show her for a while
None

Just after Christmas, one afternoon, Puck was going to the store with his mom and Rachel was holding Abby
mom has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'mom']

He'd hugged and kissed his girls, saying 'bye' and when he pulled back he waved a little to Abby
None

Abby lifted her small hand up and mirrored his wave, moving her hand and wrist, instead of her whole arm
None

It definitely needed some work, but the couple was excited she was continuing to learn and pick up things.

None

During the first weekend of the new year, it was pretty quiet at home
None

Puck and Rachel were doing their homework, late in the afternoon on Saturday, when Abby woke up from her nap
None

Once she was changed, Puck took her downstairs and settled her onto the couch, letting her sit against the back of it, but both couple stayed close to make sure she didn't get up and try to crawl towards the edge.

None

Rachel went to get one of Abby's stuffed animals and returned, kneeling down on the floor so she could be closer to eye level to her and held out the toy
None

Abby took it and began shaking it, giggling as she did
None

After a moment, she held up the item and clearly said two syllables, dada.

None

Puck and Rachel both gasped, exchanging shocked and curiously expressions before turning back to look back at Abby, what was that, Abby? Rachel asked, reaching out to tickle her tummy gently, did you say 'dada'? Say it again, she coaxed.

None

Abby giggled when Rachel tickled her and sat back a little, shaking her toy and then looked at Puck who was sitting next to her, dada, she said again.

None

Hearing it a second time, the couple knew they hadn't heard things and Puck picked her up, snuggling her against him and kissing her cheek, you really said that, he grinned, I love you, sweetie.

None

Rachel felt tears in her eyes as she took a seat next to them and hugged Puck and Abby, mommy loves you, too, she added, and I'm so proud of you.

None

Definitely, Puck agreed, shifting, so he could kiss Rachel, you know she is gonna start calling everything 'dada', right? He smirked, remembering his sister's first word was 'mama' and she called everyone and everything that for a few months before she realized who 'mama' really was.

None

Yeah, I remember reading that, but it's a start, she replied happily.

None

Mama, Abby said, having heard the sounds from her dad and was trying to repeat them.

None

Well, that was easy, Puck grinned, watching his girlfriend's eyes widen in shock.

None

You said 'mama', Rachel hugged Abby and kissed her cheek, this is amazing, she grinned, looking at Puck.

None

It is, he nodded, pressing a kiss to Rachel's lips and slipping his arm around her back, I wonder what will be next on the 'baby's firsts' list.

None

I'm in no hurry to check off any more, Rachel admitted honestly, happy she was learning more, but also knew that the more things she did, the closer it'd be to him leaving.

None

Understanding why she said that, Puck pressed another kiss to her lips and rubbed her back gently, I know, babe
None

I'm not in a hurry either, but I still am curious.

None

Nodding in agreement, Rachel took a deep breath, yeah, I am, too
None

I think walking is probably going to be her next one..
None

Well, that and getting her to understand what those words mean.

None

Yeah, there is that, Puck smirked, we'll help her figure it out, he promised.

None

Good, because I'd be pretty jealous if she called anyone else 'mama', she told him.

None

After hearing the words again, Abby said them and Rachel blushed, kissing her cheek, I'm 'mama' and he's 'dada', Abby, she said pointing to Puck.

None

Dada, Abby said again, looking at where Rachel was pointing.

None

Puck smiled at them, that's right.

None

Though Puck and Rachel knew Abby was just repeating the sounds she'd heard, not necessarily knowing what they meant yet, they settled to enjoy the moment when they heard their daughter say 'dada' and 'mama' for the first time.

None

...

None

The second Wednesday of the new year, Puck had to go do what he'd been dragging his feet on since being sworn into the Navy
None

He knew he had to have it done before going to boot camp, but he was afraid if he waited any longer he'd forget or remember just prior to leaving and have to rush through the process.

None

It wasn't a Glee day, so he was supposed to be at basketball practice after school, but he wasn't going
None

To everyone, he played it up like he had an important meeting with his recruiter; it wasn't a complete lie, he did need to check-in with him, since they hadn't seen each other for several weeks and only talked over the phone a few times, but that wasn't the only reason for him missing practice
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Ben and Ethan were the only ones who knew where he was going.

None

Puck and Rachel had gone to school in separate cars that morning, just like every day he had practice
None

After school, the couple said 'goodbye' and Puck headed to his recruiter's office for a short time, checking in, getting a weight check and some information for the appointment he had at four
None

Once he had what he needed, Puck got back into his jeep and made his way towards the office of the only lawyer he trusted to take care of what he needed; the guy who would one day be his father-in-law, Alan.

None

Going into the office, he checked in with his initials; he'd scheduled an appointment for that day under 'NP' because he didn't want Alan to find out before then and ask him around Rachel why he had an appointment scheduled
initial has no Synonyms in the API
None

The receptionist recognized him from the Berry's Christmas party a few weeks prior, and he agreed he'd seen her, but asked not to say anything to Alan until his appointment.

None

Taking a seat in the small waiting area, Puck waited patiently, his thoughts bouncing around as he stared at the large brown envelope he hand
None

It contained some documents he'd gotten while swearing in that he had to fill out and sign, along with a list of other things he needed to have done before he went to boot camp, because he wasn't married and still had a child with someone
someone has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'child', 'with', 'someone']

He hated hiding the appointment or the documents from his girlfriend, but the last thing he wanted was her worrying about the meaning of a bunch of papers that he prayed he'd never need.

None

At first he tried to keep his head down, looking at his phone, but he couldn't help glancing around the office
None

He was sitting in a small waiting area in the front by the reception desk and there was a half wall behind that where he could see into the back of the office where everyone else was
None

In the center of a large room were desks and cubicles that had people working, so he figured they were assistants and paralegals
None

Around the larger room book shelves were scattered with various encyclopedias and doors into offices, which he thought may belong to the actual lawyers and his thoughts were confirmed when he saw Alan step out of one.

encyclopedia has no Synonyms in the API
['scatter', 'with', 'encyclopedia']

Alan knew he had a four-pm appointment and he'd been told they were there, so he left his office and made his way towards the front to meet them, pausing a moment when he reached the reception area and was surprised to see Puck sitting there, Noah, what are you doing here?

None

I'm you're appointment at four, Puck replied with a smirk.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API

Really? Alan glanced and saw the receptionist nod, and then he laughed lightly, NP..
None

I should have known that was you
None

Come on back, he said, motioning behind him.

None

Puck stood up and followed him to the room he'd left, passing familiar faces he'd seen at their Christmas party and some of them nodded when they recognized him
None

Stepping into the large office, set up like he expected, a desk with a computer and files, books on book shelves, along with a round table with chairs seated around it
None

Alan closed the door behind them and motioned to the table, have a seat, Noah
None

What's up? Alan wondered, noticing the envelope in his hand as he took a seat at the table.

Pulling out one of the chairs, Puck slid into it and took a deep breath, I need to have a will drawn up, among other things, he said, and you're the only one I trust to do it
None

I'm sorry for being so secretive about this, but I didn't want Rachel or my mom worrying about it
None

Dad and Uncle Ben know, but when I made the appointment, I didn't want to use my full name, in case you saw it and wanted to bring it up at home.

None

Alan nodded in understanding, I won't say anything, unless you're alright with it, he promised, opening the envelope and finding numerous documents inside, did you get all these when you swore in?

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, he nodded, each person has to talk to a counselor to go over everything
None

Because I told them I had a daughter and wasn't married to her mother, they gave me all that and said I needed to get things sorted out, authorizing Rachel to have custody and guardianship over Abby, so if something happens to her, Rachel can make decisions without me and if, he knocked his knuckles on the wooden table, God forbid, something happens to me, there's no question who Abby belongs with, he said sitting back, I've looked over what's in there and I think some of them might be straight-forward, but I want you to look before I sign anything and I know I need more than what's in there.

None

Very good idea, Alan nodded, and some of these are simple; they deal with your benefits and things like that, but yes, some of them are a little more technical and you'll need more than a single sheet of paper
benefit has no Synonyms in the API
None

I've done this before, he motioned to them, with other clients, so I'm familiar with the process and what they want
client has no Synonyms in the API
['motion', 'with', 'client']

It's split into five sections
None

Your will, which covers your wishes if, God forbid, you did pass away
None

There's your power of attorney, which means you give permission for someone to make medical and legal decisions for you, if you're unreachable or you're injured or unconscious
None

You also have a power of attorney for Abby that you give permission for Rachel to make decisions for her, medical or anything else
None

In addition you will have a similar document that states you give all guardianship and custody to Rachel, so if something should happen to you, like you said, there's no question who Abby belongs with
who has no Synonyms in the API
None

The fifth section is your money
None

You need to have a checking account that you and someone here can have access too, that way when you get paid, your money can be accessed by someone, like Rachel, for Abby and bills, or they can put money in if you need it for something
None

Have you talked to Rachel about getting a joint account?

None

No, Puck shook his head, should I? I mean, she has her own and I have my own; I figured I'd just add her to mine; mom already has access to it, and Rachel could, too
None

My money is Rachel's and Abby's money, so I don't need my own account and then have a joint account with her, he explained, I also figured we'd have one account and she could keep hers for her photography business, he added.

None

You could, Alan agreed, and I'm not trying to say I'm skeptical, so don't take this the wrong way, but it's easier to add someone to an account than it is to remove them
None

Though you guys have a solid relationship and nothing to worry about now, if something did happen between you two, that would mean you'd have to close your account and open it again.

None

No offense taken, but I'm gonna be honest
None

You're stuck with me, he smirked.

None

No complaints here, Alan smiled glancing through the papers and slid a few towards him, these deal with that, so I don't think we need to go through them
that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Talk to Rachel and see what she says about it and go from there.

None

Alright
None

What about the rest? This isn't easy, Puck admitted, rubbing his neck nervously.

None

I know, but look at it this way; you're taking care of your family
None

David and I have wills and power of attorneys over each other and Rachel for this reason, too
None

Partially because Ohio doesn't recognize same-sex marriages, but also because we want to make sure there's no question who we want taking care of our medical or legal decisions or our daughter if we can't, Alan told him, leaning back in his chair.

None

I get that and I'm glad I'm doing that, because I want to make sure they are taken care of, but it's just tough to think about getting hurt or worse and not being able to come home to them, Puck told him, taking a deep breath.

None

Alan nodded, I understand that and I'm assuming that's why you didn't want your mom and Rachel knowing about all this right now.

None

Yeah
None

It's hard enough on Rachel knowing that I'm leaving, I just don't want her freaking out because I'm planning this type of stuff and the same with my mom
None

She's pregnant; she doesn't need that to stress about
None

I'm sure it's tough on her knowing what dad does for a living, Puck explained.

None

It probably is, but she's a pretty strong woman and so is Rachel, Alan started, then smirked, though I do know she tends to worry.

None

Exactly, Puck nodded, I love Rachel, but she worries about things she doesn't need to and for now I just want her to focus on Regionals
None

If she ends up having to sign anything or mom, too, we can tell them, but for now, it's between us.

None

That's fine with me
None

I won't say anything, but you are right
None

Some of these will need their signatures, so at some point they'll have to find out, Alan replied.

None

Glancing over to them, Puck nodded, so, about them..
None

What do you need from me?

None

Um, nothing right off the top of my head, but I do have some questions that will help get these started, Alan admitted, first off, you understand that because you and Rachel are not legally married, she can't be covered under your medical benefits, right?

None

Yeah, I know
None

Abby will be and I figure since Rachel's still in school, she's covered under your plans and, he blushed a little, sometime after she graduates, I'll propose, if you and David are alright with that, so we probably won't be unmarried for too long.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Alan nodded, we haven't been opposed to you and Rachel being together, so I don't think you need to worry about us saying 'no', he assured him, and yes she's covered, he added, glancing over some of the papers, have you thought about who will make medical decisions for you if it came down to it?

None

They told me if I'm unmarried, even if I'm with someone, that I should still have my parents be listed; at least until I get married, so mom and dad? Puck wondered, I also thought that even if I do these papers now, when Rachel and I get married legally, we can update them, right?

someone has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'someone']

Of course
None

Anytime you want
None

It's not uncommon and I was going to suggest your parents, too
None

I don't know if Rachel would be comfortable doing that right now, he replied, it's not like she'd have to make any decisions alone, because we'll all be there for her, but to have the final say, that would be tough on her.

None

Puck nodded, that's what I was thinking
None

I'm really glad you and David like me and that my family gets along with Rachel
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

I don't know what we'd be doing if someone hadn't supported us keeping Abby.

None

I honestly have never seen Rachel this happy, except when she's with you and Abby, so there's no doubt you have our support, Alan commented.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Thanks, Puck smiled and shifted a little, that means a lot and I promise I'll do anything I can to make sure she stays happy.

None

I know you will, Alan returned his smile.

None

...

None

Alan and Puck talked for a little longer, going over each paper Puck brought along and Alan was jotting notes down on a yellow legal pad
None

At the beginning, Puck had been nervous about what he was doing, but after talking with Alan, he calmed down, especially when Alan assured him he was doing the right thing and this was ensuring his family was taken care of if something happened to him
alan has no Synonyms in the API
None

He still hated the idea that something could happen, but he settled knowing that Alan was right
None

Everything he was doing now, would be taking care of Rachel and Abby
None

Alan told him it could take a few weeks to get everything together and there would be some papers Rachel and his parents would have to sign, so Puck knew he had to talk to them at some point
None

He didn't want to, but decided he'd at least bring it up, so they weren't surprised when it came time to sign things and Alan agreed it was the best idea, so everyone was there in case Rachel needed to talk about how she felt about them.

None

Thanking Alan for everything he was doing, Puck left the office just after five, knowing he'd be seeing Alan and David by six, since they were coming over for dinner
None

Getting home, Puck greeted his girlfriend and daughter and Rachel asked him how his meeting went with his recruiter
recruiter has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'recruiter']

He really had gone, so he told her some of the things that came up, mostly about the book he was supposed to be reading and some things with boot camp
None

He also mentioned he was happy he was still in the weight range he was supposed to be in and just had to maintain it until June.

None

When Alan and David arrived that evening, and Deborah, Ethan and Arin joined them, the family went on as if nothing had been out of the ordinary
None

After dinner, Alan, Ethan and Puck offered to do the dishes, so the others went into the living room, which gave them a chance to talk
None

They only brought up Alan needing a few weeks to get things together and Ethan and Puck agreed they'd talk to Deborah and Rachel a little so they could be ready.

None

...

None

Now that the papers were being worked on, Puck pushed aside his worries for them and tried to focus on his family and what they were doing at school without letting it bother him.

None

The next few weeks of January continued on, with a few more basketball games and practices, along with Glee practice for their upcoming competition
game has no Synonyms in the API
['continue', 'with', 'game']

Everyone was happy that they were doing well with preparations; confident they'd be ready for Regionals in just a few more weeks.

preparation has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'preparation']

Outside of school and practices, Ethan and Puck spent some of their free time sorting out what materials they would need for the garage rebuild
None

They, along with Rachel, had decided that since they didn't plan to use the garage for cars, they'd put up a wall down the center, giving half of the garage space for Rachel's photography studio and the other half would be for everything else.

None

Ethan and Puck also had a few more hockey games to attend, giving the father and son a break from their day-to-day lives, and also some time together they'd lost from all the years Ethan had been gone
None

Even though Puck had forgiven Ethan and they were getting closer as time went on, the trips to the games gave them both some time to learn more about each other
None

To Puck, it seemed like after every trip, more memories of missing his dad seemed to fade into the back of his mind, being replaced by new memories of them together.

None

Deborah also had a busy January
None

While the Glee Club was preparing for Regionals, she, Quinn and the Cheerios were preparing for their National competition, this year being held in Indianapolis, and fell on the last weekend of January and Deborah was thankful it was close enough they could just ride a bus and not fly like the year before.

None

...

None

As January neared the end, Puck talked to Rachel once about the paperwork Alan was preparing for him
None

He didn't go into too many details, but enough so she understood he had to have the paperwork done before going to boot camp and he wanted to make sure that she and Abby were taken care of while he was gone
None

He avoided telling her the additional reason was 'in case something happened' to him.

None

Surprisingly, Rachel was already aware of the paperwork he was talking about; something she'd seen brought up on a Navy family forum, so it didn't come as a complete shock, like Puck had first thought it would
None

It was something he was relieved about, but still silently worried that when she saw the type of documents involved and how serious they were, she'd get upset.

None

The last Wednesday of January, after their usual family dinner with her dads and Puck's family, Alan brought out all of the paperwork for them to go over and sign
None

Once Abby was settled into her playpen and Arin was busy watching TV in the living room, Puck, Rachel and their parents settled around the dinning room table to talk.

None

That's an awful lot of papers for guardianship and power of attorney for Abby, Rachel commented, seeing the thick stack.

None

It's, um, not just for that, Puck admitted, glancing at Rachel from across the table
None

He and David and switched seats so he could sit next to Alan, because he'd be doing most of the signing, there's also stuff for me, too, um, in case anything happened to me.

None

Rachel's eyes fell closed and she took a deep breath, nodding, I see, she bit her lip, I should have figured that out, too, she added, is one of them your will?

None

Yeah, Puck nodded, getting up and moving around the table to kneel down next to her and rested his hands on her hips, I told you the other day that I had to do this before boot camp and what my recruiter calls it is 'getting your affairs in order'
None

I just want to make sure that you and Abby are taken care of if something happened to me
None

I'm not saying anything will, but just in case.

None

I know, she rested her hands on his cheeks as she looked at him, when you were telling me about all the paperwork for Abby, I should have figured that out, too, she glanced towards the living room where Abby was contently playing in her playpen, we almost lost you once
None

I don't like thinking about that happening again.

None

Neither do I, he assured her, and I promise I'll do everything I can to stay safe so I can come home to you two, he glanced over at the papers and then back to her, standing up and kissing her, but these just make sure that things are taken care of if something did happen, he said softly, unable to resist knocking on the wooden table.

None

Rachel smiled lightly and nodded, I know, she stood up and slid her arms around him, I love you.

None

I love you, too, he replied, holding her tightly.

None

...

None

After the moment with his girlfriend, they got back to what they were doing
None

They started out signing the papers that dealt with Abby
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

He and Rachel signed those, one of the papers agreeing that if anything should happen to him, all custody and guardianship goes to Rachel and the other papers dealt with Puck giving Rachel permission to make any medical decisions and any other type of care for her without his consent, because he wouldn't always be reachable.

None

Content they had all the correct information in the paperwork, they moved onto the next set
None

Alan had written up Puck's will exactly how he wanted it, when they first talked about it in his office and Puck signed it once he read over it
None

Moving on to the last section of papers, they were for Puck's legal and medical power of attorney, meaning that if he was deemed unfit to make decisions or unconscious, he authorized his parents to make the decisions
None

It also helped with any issues back home, his parents could sign things for him or update or cancel things in his name without him being there, because he'd given them permission to do it.

issue has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'with', 'issue']

Deborah and Ethan signed a few of the papers and when they finished, Puck scrawled his signature across the page and then they moved onto the papers he just needed to sign
None

Most of them were how he wanted benefits sorted out and other details that needed to be taken care of
None

Now all he had to do was take care of the papers for the bank account and he had time to do that, still needing to talk to Rachel about what she wanted to do.

None

With everything signed, Alan slid it all back into the folder he had, wanting to go through them one more time to make sure everything had been signed and filled out before saying they were done and promised to get them to him by the weekend
None

Soon Alan and David left, followed by Arin, Deborah and Ethan, since the paperwork had taken longer than expected and they all had to work in the morning.

None

After their families left, Puck and Rachel spent some time with Abby and then got her ready and down for bed, before the couple settled into the living room to work on their homework
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Um, are you alright after earlier? Puck asked, a little while later, sliding off the couch to sit next to her by the coffee table where she was working.

None

Yes, Rachel nodded, I am
None

It's tough to think about, but I know it's only to protect us if something happened
None

I don't like thinking about it, but I'm alright, she assured him, are you okay?

None

Yeah, he shrugged, I guess
None

Seems a lot more real now
None

It definitely is a tough conversation to have and I'm sorry I kept most of it from you, but I just didn't want you to worry
None

You've been pretty focused on Glee and I didn't want it to distract you.

None

She smiled lightly and leaned against his chest, it's always in the back of my mind
None

I just choose not to let to take over.

None

Sliding his arm around her shoulders, he kissed her forehead, I'm always gonna be with you, even if we are hundreds or thousands of miles apart, he murmured.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Damn right you are, Puckerman, she grinned, looking up at him, and don't you ever forget it.

None

I promise I won't, he returned her smile and pressed a kiss to her lips, meaning his promise completely
None

He wasn't 

None

 Puck anymore; he'd grown up and now there was only 

None

 person in his romantic life and she is and always will be Rachel Marie Berry; soon to be Puckerman and he'd never intentionally jeopardize their relationship.

None

Are you okay with me giving my parents the right to take care of decisions for me? He wondered after a few short moments.

None

Rachel nodded, continuing to relax against his chest, we're not married, so I think it's only right they have that power
None

It's also not really a big deal, because I have a good relationship with them, so I don't think they'd make a big decision without at least talking to me first.

None

That's what I was thinking
None

I mean, since I wasn't married it was recommended that I go with my parents, but when I thought about it, I realized that most big decisions we make as a family or at least talk about and if what they had to decide effected you or Abby, I know they'd talk to you about it first, Puck replied, I just wanted to make sure
parent has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'parent']

Considering I was giving you the power over Abby, I didn't know how you'd feel about...

None

Leaning up, Rachel pressed a kiss to her boyfriend's lips, silencing his words, you did the right thing, she assured him, I'm alright with that and when we do get married, we can change them, she added.

None

Puck smiled, nodding at her words, okay, cool
None

I'm glad you're alright with things.

None

She nodded, kissing him again, I am definitely alright with things
None

You made the right call.

None

...

None

A few days later, after school on the last Friday of January, Deborah and the Cheerios went home long enough to collect their overnight bags and say 'goodbye' to their families for the weekend
None

Puck and Finn had said their goodbyes to Deborah and Quinn at school, because the basketball team had an away game that night and they wouldn't be able to see them off
None

Rachel, Abby and Arin said 'goodbye' and 'good luck' to Deborah and Quinn at home, and then Ethan drove them to school to meet the bus that was taking them to Nationals.

None

Leaving home this year for Nationals was a lot tougher than it had been the year before
None

Now, not only did Deborah have her kids she was saying 'goodbye' to, she also had another daughter, Rachel, and a granddaughter she cared for just as much as her own children
None

On top of her children, she also had a husband that she hadn't slept apart from since they'd gotten married and hated leaving him
None

When Ethan dropped her and Quinn off at McKinley, Quinn started checking people in, so Deborah could have some time to say 'goodbye', and Ethan promised her the time would fly by and they could still talk on the phone
None

She knew a lot of her nerves and emotions were from pregnancy hormones, but she still was going to miss him and couldn't wait until she got home.

None

...

None

The basketball team ended up losing their away game and knew that the following Friday would be their final game of the season and Puck was looking forward the extra time he could have after school to spend with his girlfriend and their daughter.

With Deborah gone for the weekend, Ethan and Arin got some father-daughter bonding in and still hung out with Rachel, Puck, Abby and Rachel's dads like they did a lot on the weekends
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

Everyone missed Deborah and talked to her a few times Saturday, but they wouldn't know until Sunday afternoon what place the team took, but everyone was curious.

None

The Cheerios ended up taking second place and for the Senior girls, they felt like they came out on top, because they'd taken third the year before
None

Ethan and Arin picked up Deborah and Quinn at McKinley when they got back Sunday evening, after their three hour bus ride from Indianapolis and though they were looking forward to getting home, they joined the Berrys, Puckermans, Hummels and Hudsons at Rachel and Puck's house for a small party to celebrate their second place finish and to welcome them home.

None

...

None

Returning to school on Monday, the Cheerios were congratulated and now that their competition was over, the Glee Club could focus even more on their songs for Regionals
None

Monday was also the beginning of a new semester at McKinley, so a lot of students had classes that changed, but Puck and Rachel's classes didn't, so they were glad they could finish out the rest of their year, together, in the same classes.

None

In the middle of the week, David and Alan found out their bid had been accepted for the house just down the street from Ben and Susan's house, not even a block away from Puck and Rachel
None

The family got to celebrate the news together and Rachel was excited for when they could start moving in on the first of March and Puck, Ethan and others offered to help out, knowing their plan were to keep their current house and fix it up to sell it by the summer, giving everyone an additional project to help with.

None

By the end of the week, at the home and final basketball game of the season, Rachel and Abby, who wore earplugs, along with Rachel's dads, Ethan, Arin, Ben's wife and daughters and several of the Glee Club members came to cheer on their friends
None

Abby did pretty well at the game, only getting upset and fussy a few times because of the noise, because the earplugs helped drown out a lot of the painful sounds.

None

McKinley won their final basketball game of the season and even though it wasn't enough to go to a championship, the Senior guys were happy they could end the season on a happy note
None

Puck loved having his girlfriend and daughter, and the rest of their families in the audience, but the best part for him was getting a hug and kiss from his girlfriend and daughter at the end of the game, before he and the rest of the guys jogged into the locker room to shower and change.

None

...

None

Ethan and Puck had a Saturday hockey game in Detroit, so they went up, using it as a break from basketball and Glee, knowing the following week would be stressful because Regionals was the next weekend.

None

When Monday arrived, the Glee Club was down to crunch time, because Friday morning they were leaving McKinley and heading to Detroit for Regionals
None

Using part of their lunch time every day to practice, along with after school, the club was finally confident they were ready.

None

Thursday evening, David and Alan stayed at Rachel and Puck's house and were going to stay the whole weekend to take care of Abby
None

Waking up Friday morning, two hours earlier than normal, everyone was busy and nervous
None

Puck's uncle, another Glee director was going on the trip with them and so was Puck's cousin Jessica
None

Arin wanted to stay with Hannah, Susan and Ben's daughter, so that morning, after Arin said 'goodbye' and 'good luck' to Puck and Rachel, and Ethan and Deborah had exchanged goodbyes with David and Alan, the two adults took Arin down to Ben and Susan's house to drop her off and Ben and Jessica followed them to McKinley.

It had been some time since Rachel and Puck had been away from Abby overnight, so they were nervous about leaving
None

After several trips through the house, a lot of hugs and kisses to their daughter and David and Alan promising everything would be alright, Puck had to coax Rachel out of the house to keep her from continually fussing over everything.

None

Arriving at McKinley, the couple met up with his parents, uncle, cousin, Kurt, Finn and Quinn, who had left the Hudson's house around the same time and all of them parked near the back of the parking lot where the bus was waiting for them

['meet', 'with', 'parent']

Unloading their cars and slowly packing the bus, students and chaperones slowly arrived and time was ticking closer to their departure time.

None

In addition of his clothes for the next few days, Ethan also brought his hockey gear
None

Mike, his friend and former teammate, along with the rest of the Detroit Police Department hockey team begged for Ethan to return to the team for their annual game against the city's fire department, which happened to be the same weekend as Regionals
None

Ethan wasn't sure of the schedule, but once he found out they'd have Saturday afternoon free again, he agreed to play, even though he hadn't been on the ice for a year
None

The returning club members knew about the game and were excited to go again, and Ethan made sure he had enough tickets waiting for everyone to come, if they wanted.

None

Once all the students and chaperones had arrived, the bus left McKinley just after seven-am, beginning their trip to Detroit, about a two and a half hour bus ride
None

Most everyone used the time to sleep, knowing they'd had an early morning and would be performing that afternoon, so they needed to be rested.

time has no Synonyms in the API

Will wanted Ethan to direct the bus driver once they got closer to Detroit, so Ethan woke up from his nap and made his way to the front of the bus, where he could have a clearer view of where they were
None

A little after two hours into their trip, they were hitting the Detroit city limits and it didn't take long for Ethan to show the driver a shortcut around some of the major traffic areas that got them to their hotel in a decent amount of time.

None

Well, this brings back memories, Puck commented realizing they were staying at the same hotel they had the year before.

None

Deborah smiled, yeah it does
None

Definitely good ones, she agreed, hugging Ethan once he returned to his seat, while Emma and Will went to check them in.

None

Ethan nodded, about this time last year I was just getting back from an early morning call and trying to sleep for a few hours before coming up to see you guys
None

I didn't know what to expect, but I was looking forward to it.

None

Puck smiled, I was definitely nervous
None

I didn't know what to think or do..
None

I'm just, he blushed, I'm glad we finally met up, he said honestly, turning to look at Ethan and Deborah in the seat behind him and Rachel, your call at Christmas started it all and this was the next big moment in the return of our family.

None

It was, Ethan agreed, I know I fucked up big time by leaving, but it definitely was a huge turning point in our relationship, especially seeing you all, meeting Arin, and then proposing to you, he smiled at Deborah, that was a great moment.

None

Deborah nodded, it was a very great moment
None

I honestly never thought it would happen, but I wouldn't change a thing about this past year
None

You're back in our lives and that's something I always dreamed of, she admitted honestly.

None

Ethan pressed a kiss to her lips, me too and I'm not going anywhere, he promised, resting his hand on her stomach, then looked at her and Puck, I'm not making that mistake again.

None

Puck nodded, we know and believe you, he said honestly, getting his mom's nod in agreement
None

Looking at their joined hands, now resting on her swollen stomach, he smiled, we've been through a rough few years, but it's in the past and the past year has been the start of our new life as a family and I know we're all looking forward to the addition to our family, he said, motioning to the baby growing inside her.

None

...

None

Ethan, Deborah, Rachel, Ben, Jessica, Finn and Quinn agreed with Puck's words and the small, but important family moment came to a close when Will and Emma returned with room keys for everyone

['return', 'with', 'key']

Slowly everyone was given their room assignments and the roommates gathered their things and made their way inside the hotel and up to their floor.

None

When Will and the other directors had sorted out room assignments for the club members, Deborah's room was going to have Rachel, Quinn and Jessica, Ethan had Puck, Finn and Kurt and Ben was going to be rooming with Matt, Mike and TJ, his daughter's boyfriend, so TJ was definitely nervous to be that close to Ben, but Jessica made Ben promise not to scare him too much and he gave in, promising he'd be 'good'.

Once all the kids and adults had been settled into their rooms and dropped off their belongings, they gathered up their items for their performance and were piling back onto the bus and heading to the venue.

None

...

None

McKinley's New Directions arrived at the venue just after eleven and checked in
None

At noon, their practice room was open, so the club gathered together to run through their numbers for that day, Rachel and Puck's ballad and Kurt and Tina's duet with the rest of the club as background vocals for both
None

Once everyone was confident in their routine, they began to get ready, having a lot more members than the year before, but by two-thirty, they were down by the stage and ready to go on at three.

None

Rachel and Puck's ballad was their opening number and during the chorus the rest of the club joined them on stage to continue on and then Kurt and Tina's upbeat number ended their set for the day
None

By the end, everyone was excited and confident they'd be going on to the next round, but wouldn't find out until Saturday evening, so they all returned to their hotel where some walked to a nearby restaurant, while others ordered in, like Puck, Rachel and their close family and friends.

None

Joining them for pizza were some of Ethan's former teammates and after dinner, Ethan and the guys talked about the game and they gave him the tickets for everyone in the club
None

Since it had been so long since Ethan had been on the ice, Mike was going to pick Ethan up around eight, so they could get to the arena early and get some practice in before the game started at noon, and they decided that the club would leave the hotel around ten-thirty, to be at the arena by eleven.

None

When the guys left that night, everyone was getting excited and Rachel, Puck, Quinn and Finn started passing around the news and times to everyone so they knew what time they needed to get up, everyone promising they'd be on the bus by ten-thirty the next morning.

None

Finn, Puck and Ethan didn't want to sleep apart from their partners, but they all agreed that they were on a school trip and didn't want anyone to get pissed because the guys and girls slept together, so they reluctantly returned to their rooms to sleep apart.

None

...

None

Saturday morning, Mike picked up Ethan by eight and the two men headed to the Red Wings arena, while everyone was just starting to get up
None

Having coffee and breakfast in the hotel's cafÃ© that morning, everyone was on the bus by ten-thirty and on their way to the arena
None

Because Puck had been so familiar with the drive, he gave the driver directions and soon they were being dropped off in front of the arena, like the year before.

None

This year, instead of wearing whatever, Ethan had given some of them Detroit SRT shirts, the name of his former team, and Puck, Finn, Rachel and a few others had them on, and others were wearing shades of blue, in support of the police team
None

Getting inside, they found seats in the police section and settled in, hoping they would win again like the year before.

None

At eleven-forty-five, the two teams came out of their locker rooms, dressed in their pads and new uniforms, and all skated around the arena in greeting
None

When Ethan passed by his family and friends, he turned and showed the back of his uniform and instead of it being 'Ballard 20', this year it was 'Ballard-Puckerman 20', using his legal last name.

None

His family cheered for the name change and Rachel snapped pictures when she could, getting a few great shots of Ethan on the ice before the teams lined up in the center of the ice for the National Anthem
None

After honoring the flag, the teams went to their sides of the rink and the starting players waited for the game to start.

None

...

None

The hockey game, like once was said, seemed to be a tennis match on ice
None

The puck was knocked around between firefighters and cops and there was pushing and shoving on both sides trying to make goals
None

By the mid-game break, the teams were tied and Ethan had been roughed up, because he'd played the entire time and the firefighters knew he was one of their best players; he'd been slammed into the wall several times to steal the puck.

None

The last part of the game was just as brutal, but Ethan and one of the other players returned the favor and Ethan was able to score a goal and Mike scored another, bringing the cops ahead of the firefighters in the last few minutes
None

The cops won the game again and their fans cheered and celebrated over the firefighters, but it was all for a good cause, so no one was too upset about it.

None

As the arena began to thin out, the McKinley students and their chaperones waited for Ethan and when he and a few of his guys from his former team joined them, they talked and congratulated them on their win
None

Mike was glad to see Ethan so happy and also looked forward to meeting Ethan's next child
None

During their conversation, Ethan suggested that once the weather got nicer, his former team and their families should come down to visit and meet his current team and have a big Spring party
None

The guys liked that and agreed to talk later, knowing Ethan and the club needed to get back for their evening results.

None

While talking, the rest of Ethan's former team who didn't play hockey, joined them and the celebrations and congratulations continued for a short time, not only for the win, but also for the baby on the way
None

Puck also got a chance to talk face-to-face with Nate, the guy who had been in the Navy before joining Ethan's former team
nate has no Synonyms in the API
None

He and Puck had been keeping in touch through Facebook, and hadn't seen each other since summer, so they compared their swearing in stories and the things Puck had done so far in preparation for leaving and Nate thought he was on a great track, encouraging him to keep on it and to talk to him if he ever had any questions and Puck assured him he would.

None

Hanging out for a little longer, slowly they moved outside to meet their bus and Ethan's friends said 'goodbye' and wished the teens 'good luck' at Regionals and promised to see everyone soon.

None

...

None

Out of thirty schools at Regionals, half didn't make it any further, and McKinley was part of the ones who would be performing their final number for the judges the next day
None

McKinley took second, right under Mississippi's Clinton High School AttachÃ© and Carmel's Vocal Adrenaline took third, the same rankings as the previous year.

None

After the announcements of the top five schools, Rachel saw Shelby and spoke to her briefly; Shelby congratulated Rachel and the rest of McKinley's team for a great job and wished them luck the next day
None

Rachel and Shelby were not close by any means, but they both settled for a simple relationship of just friends.

None

On Sunday afternoon, McKinley would be performing and unlike the year before, they wouldn't have to wait until the next day to find out if they would be going to nationals; they'd be finding that night.

None

Rachel and Quinn's upbeat duet was McKinley's final chance to show the judges they deserved to go to Nationals
None

In less than five minutes, the two girls, who had gone from enemies to close friends, like sisters, had pulled off an amazing vocal performance with their friends as back up
None

As their number ended, the girls hugged, so happy that their relationship had grown so much and knew it was something neither wanted to give up.

None

Celebrating briefly in their practice room, the teens changed and everyone went back to the hotel to pack up their belongings, planning to leave once they found out the final results
None

A little after four they returned and founds seats in the venue to wait for the results at five.

None

Other schools began piling in, everyone waiting to find out where they placed and at the start of the result announcements, the bottom ten schools were listed in alphabetical order, and those schools cleared out, leaving New Directions, Vocal Adrenaline, AttachÃ© and two other schools left
None

They would be going onto Nationals, no matter what rank they were, but each team waited for their name to be called to get their trophy.

None

The fourth and fifth place school were announced and they were given their small trophies and the other three schools waited to find out if their places had changed from the day before
None

Though the year before they had been surprised, the three school's ranks hadn't changed, from the first and second rounds, meaning that Vocal Adrenaline took third, McKinley took second and AttachÃ© was first.

None

Will, Shelby and the coach from AttachÃ© went up to collect their trophies and returned to their teams to celebrate, sharing hugs with everyone, looking forward to Nationals

By the time they were on their bus and starting their journey back to Lima, New Directions was already brainstorming ideas for music
None

They nominated Puck and Rachel to continue with the ballad because they did them so well and the couple was open to it because it would be the last time they could sing together, so they gladly agreed, once everyone assured them they were okay with it.

ballad has no Synonyms in the API
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Someone mentioned that the Seniors should take leads on a song or at least a portion of a song, but Mike, Matt and Ryan were not comfortable with that, which left Quinn, Finn and Puck
None

The three were not against the idea, but Puck had an idea for all the guys and wanted to keep a secret for the moment
None

Quinn asked Rachel if she wanted to do another duet and several others agreed that Rachel and Quinn's duet had been amazing for Regionals, and thought they'd sound equally amazing on something for Nationals.

None

Getting an okay, they agreed on the guys doing one song, Quinn and Rachel singing lead on another and Puck and Rachel covering their ballad
None

On the rest of the trip, they started suggesting song ideas and would figure out which ones they'd do later.

None

...

None

Arriving home late Sunday night, everyone was glad to be home earlier than planned, especially the parents
None

They'd left Detroit a little after seven and by the time they got back to the school, unloaded their bags, packed up their cars and went home, it was after ten when Puck and Rachel walked into their house
None

Rachel's dads were still awake, but they had already put Abby down for the night and as much as the young couple wanted to see her, they also knew if she woke up, it'd take forever to get her back to sleep, so they reluctantly agreed to wait until morning.

None

Chatting with her dads for a short time, they all went to bed, Puck and Rachel tired from the days events and glad they didn't have to go to school the next day
dad has no Synonyms in the API
['chat', 'with', 'dad']

Originally, they were supposed to get back to McKinley the next afternoon, so all their permission slips had excused them though that day, so Will told them he'd explain things to Figgins so they could have the day off
None

The teens were happy for the break, especially for the couples, because that day happened to be Valentine's Day, so they had a chance to spend some time with their significant other.

other has no Synonyms in the API
None

David and Alan let Rachel and Puck sleep in the next morning, taking care of Abby when she got up and when the teen couple finally emerged from their room, showered and dressed, they were excited to see Abby.

None

Finding Abby in her play pen with a stuffed animal, Rachel moved towards her, Abby.

None

Hearing a familiar voice and her name, Abby turned her head to the sound and found Rachel, so she grinned, reaching up for her, mama.

None

As expected, since Abby first said those words, she had been calling everyone 'mama' and 'dada', but in the last few weeks they'd been working a little more on trying to point out who they were and she was finally understanding what they meant
None

Rachel happily picked her up and kissed her cheek as she hugged her, that's right, I'm mama, she murmured, we missed you so much.

None

Abby looked at her and rested a hand on her cheek, mama, she said again.

None

Rachel grinned brightly and nodded at her, very good, she turned to look at Puck who was a few feet away, who's that? She asked, pointing to him.

None

Dada, Abby answered, reaching her arms out to him.

None

Puck moved towards them and shared Rachel's grin, I am, he nodded, kissing her cheek and taking her into his arms.

None

She's been pointing to pictures of you two and saying 'mama' or 'dada' since you guys left, David admitted, motioning to various framed pictures they had sitting on shelves or hanging on the walls, we didn't say anything when we talked to you this weekend, because we knew you guys would be upset and didn't think you'd be able to focus on the competition if you knew.

None

That was a good idea, Puck agreed, looking at Abby, and I think it's safe to say she's figured out what those words mean, he added, slipping his free arm around Rachel.

None

One of the best Valentine's gifts ever, she said honestly, wiping her eyes, and then hugging Puck and kissing Abby again.

None

It definitely is, Puck nodded.

None

...

None

Letting the news travel to their family and friends, Puck and Rachel were very happy to spend Valentine's Day celebrating a new milestone for Abby and their family
None

Everyone was happy to hear about what Abby had started doing and Rachel's dads stayed a little longer to celebrate with them, but soon they packed their bags and headed home, knowing the teens would want some alone time for the holiday.

Puck ordered some flowers to be delivered that afternoon for Rachel and he made dinner that night and the couple enjoyed the quiet day with their daughter.

Now that Abby knew who 'mama' and 'dada' were, Abby's parents were wondering how much longer until she started walking
None

Since the new year, she'd been crawling all over and would sometimes push herself up to stand against or hold onto the couch and in early February, she had began taking a few steps holding on to the couch, the table or even her parents, but as soon as she'd let go to try, she'd fall right down; her legs not quite ready to walk yet.

None

They had the house pretty well baby proofed, at least the downstairs, but now that Abby seemed more interested in standing and trying to walk, the week after Regionals, they focused their free time on making sure things were up high enough that she couldn't reach them or they were secured so she couldn't open doors or cabinets.

None

Puck and Rachel also tried to get Abby to hold onto their hands to walk, but she wouldn't have it
None

They didn't know if she was being stubborn and 'didn't want help' or if her body just wasn't ready for that yet, so they tried not to push her too much, knowing she'd walk when she was ready.

None

A week after Valentine's Day was a holiday, so school was out and Puck and Rachel were at home
None

Arin was over at her cousin's house and Deborah was hanging out with Puck and Rachel for the day
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['hang', 'with', 'puck']

Puck and Rachel were sitting on opposite sides of the living room, keeping Abby away from some things while she crawled around and they were also tossing around a stuffed basketball that Puck had picked up for her during basketball season
None

Kona was laying on her bed in the corner, keeping an eye on Abby, but trusting that Rachel and Puck were not going to hurt her, so she gave them some space, but was ready to jump if she needed to.

None

Abby had started sitting next to Rachel and would try to throw the ball to Puck, but it wouldn't go too far, so she and Puck would crawl towards it at the same time
None

He'd tickle her and she'd giggle and then he'd let her try to throw it to him again
None

When she would, he'd take it back to where he'd been sitting and she'd join him
None

He'd let her throw it to Rachel and then they would do the same thing, so they were back and forth, tossing the ball and just enjoying the time together.

None

Deborah thought the moment was adorable and actually recorded a few minutes of it on Rachel's camera, but she didn't expect to capture anything more than Abby and her parents playing with one of her toys
one has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'one']

She was proved wrong a few moments later when Abby tossed the ball a short distance
None

Instead of crawling towards it in the middle of the floor like she had been, she crawled to the coffee table, sat up on her knees and pulled herself up so she was standing up, holding onto the coffee table
None

It wasn't too unusual, because she had done it before, but this time, she turned around, let go of the table and took a few steps towards the plush toy in the middle of the floor.

None

Seeing her on the move, Kona jumped up from her bed and went to sit next to Puck, checking things out
None

Rachel was kneeling a few feet away and her mouth fell open in shock and just stared at Abby, watching her pick up the toy and walk it to her, as if it was no big deal, oh Abby, I'm so proud of you, Rachel gasped, taking the toy from her and then scooping her up in a loving hug.

None

Did she just..
None

I'm not seeing things, am I? Puck asked, looking at his mom and girlfriend.

None

You're not, Deborah replied, still recording and glad she had thought to do that.

None

She just walked on her own, Rachel said in disbelief and then took a deep breath and set Abby's feet back down on the carpet and handed her the toy, pointing to Puck, can you take this to dada? She asked her, trying not to burst into tears.

None

Dada, Abby said, then took the toy in her hands, pushed away from Rachel and began walking to Puck, closing the space between them.

None

Puck sat up on his knees and held out his arms to her and she walked right to him, without stumbling
None

Smiling brightly, he put his hands under her arms and lifted her up over his head, Abby, you're walking! He commented, pulling her into his chest and hugging her, I'm so proud of you! He admitted, kissing her cheek.

None

Rachel moved towards them and put her arms around him and Abby, me too, she agreed as tears fell from her eyes, our little girl is growing up.

None

Slipping an arm around Rachel, he held his girls while he continued to kneel on the floor, she definitely is, but she'll always be our baby girl.

None

She will be, Rachel agreed, reaching to tickle Abby's tummy.

None

Mama, Abby giggled.

None

Puck smiled and glanced at his mom, seeing her setting the camera down, how much did you get on video? He asked, knowing she had been recording.

None

The whole thing
None

I was recording you guys at first, but I didn't expect to get her first steps
None

I guess there was a reason I had the idea to record what you guys were doing, she admitted with a smile, wiping her own eyes.

Thank you, mom, Rachel grinned, I can't wait to watch it, she added
None

I still can't believe she just did that..
None

I mean, just one second she was crawling and the next she was walking.

None

Sometimes that's how it happens, Deborah commented, she might have just gotten tired of crawling and took a chance
None

Now that's she's even more mobile than she was before, you guys are going to have your hands full, she added with a grin.

Rachel looked at Kona, Kona, you're gonna have to help us keep an eye on her, she told the German Sheppard.

None

Kona looked at her and tipped her head a little, as if she was trying to understand what Rachel said and then took a few steps towards them, and laid down right next to Puck, who was still holding Abby.

None

Kona knows what she's gotta do, don't ya, girl? Puck asked the dog and then turned back to Rachel, we've already extra-baby-proofed the house and have baby gates ready to go up, so I think we'll be okay.

None

Rachel took a deep breath and nodded, I hope so, she sighed and couldn't help the blush growing on her cheeks, I..
None

I still can't believe she's walking.

None

Puck hugged her to him and kissed her forehead, yeah, it's definitely a surprise, but it's also really cool.

At his words, Rachel smiled, yes, I do agree

It is very cool.

When Abby began walking, she was nine-months, three-weeks old; time was going by too fast for everyone and Puck and Rachel hoped she'd hold off on any more milestones for a while
None

The couple, along with their friends and family, were happy that she was walking, but it meant she was growing up and it was closer to graduation and Puck leaving for boot camp.

None

The week after Abby's big milestone, the Glee club was already working on two of their songs for Nationals; their ballad sung by Puck and Rachel and an upbeat song sung by Quinn and Rachel
None

Puck wanted to keep his idea for the guys a surprise from the girls, for a while, so the teens, Will, Ben and Ethan met during lunch one day at school
None

Puck told them his idea and they all really liked his idea and nominated Puck and Finn to sing the lead, since it was their last competition.

None

Puck and Finn agreed, as long as Mike and Matt, their two best dancers, choreographed the dance routine
None

The two guys had helped them on other numbers in the past, but this was their last chance to do something for the club
None

Matt and Mike agreed, so with them choreographing and Puck and Finn singing lead, they were all looking forward to what the girls thought when they showed them in a few weeks
None

Until then they'd work on it during lunch a few days each week.

None

The last Saturday of February, Ethan and Puck went up to Detroit for another hockey game and the time away was nice
None

They knew they had things going on at home they needed to be working on, but a break from everything was okay once and a while
None

Ethan was also trying it ignore the nerves for Monday; the day he and Deborah would hopefully find out the gender of the baby.

None

When Monday arrived, which also was the last day of February, Ethan took an extended lunch break and picked Deborah up at McKinley and headed to her doctor's appointment
None

During her last few sonograms, the baby was in the wrong position, so they hadn't been able to find out
None

The only thing they knew for sure was he or she had a healthy heartbeat and was growing at a good rate
None

Ethan and Deborah had settled for that, but hoped they could find out.

None

The couple was only gone two hours, so Puck made it a point to stop into her office between his fifth and sixth period classes to see if he could get answers
None

Deborah told him they'd found out, but she refused to tell him, wanting to tell the whole family that night
None

Puck didn't have long to try to get it out of her, so he gave up and let the others try after school, to get her or Ethan to say something during Glee, but neither let anything slip.

None

That evening, after the various families and friends had dinner at home, Deborah's brother and his family, the Hudsons and Quinn, the Hummels, the Berrys and the Puckermans gathered at Deborah, Ethan and Arin's house to make the announcement.

None

Alright mom, dad, you guys have kept the secret long enough
None

Is it a girl or boy? Puck asked, really curious what his new sibling would be.

None

Deborah and Ethan moved to the front of the living room and looked around for a moment, yes we did find out, Deborah confirmed, as she rested her hand on her stomach
None

Ethan's hand joined hers and they both happily said, we're having a girl!

None

The entire room erupted in clapping and words of congratulations as Arin and Puck got up and moved towards their parents to be the first ones to hug them
None

The siblings started a chain reaction as others went to personally congratulate them and once everyone settled down, Puck smirked, so are you guys sure it's a girl?

None

Yes, Deborah nodded, she was laying at the right angle to see for sure, she explained, handing him one of the sonogram photos they'd gotten, we sort of already knew, after my last appointment, actually.

None

What? And you didn't tell us? Puck wondered, surprised.

None

Well, when they did the last sonogram, my doctor thought he could tell it was a girl, but then agreed it could also be just the angle, so he told us not to make any plans yet
None

We decided not to tell anyone, because we didn't really know and didn't want to get any hopes up
None

This time there's no doubt it's a girl, Deborah told them.

None

That makes sense
None

And some couples don't even find out until the baby is born, Rachel added.

None

Very true
None

We had thought of that, because we would love them the same either way, but we decided to find out
None

We're tired of waiting, Ethan commented.

None

Someone was getting impatient, actually, Deborah laughed, patting him on the arm.

None

The room got a laugh out of that as Ethan blushed a little.

None

Have you guys thought of names? Carole wondered.

None

Sort of
None

We have a lot of ideas, but we're still looking
None

We agreed we're going to continue giving them Puckerman as a last name, so all of our kids are the same, Deborah admitted.

None

And we probably will have a few options picked out, but we'll make the final decision when we meet her, Ethan added.

Having spent several days in February signing papers and having meetings about their new house, the first day of March, David and Alan were officially handed the keys because it was finally theirs
None

Deborah, Ethan, Arin, Rachel, Puck and Abby were the first to be inside and Ben and his family joined them, since they lived just 2 houses down the street from them.

None

The Berry men didn't expect to live in the house for several months
None

Since it was newly built, they didn't have any remodeling to do, but they had several years of belongings in their current house to pack up and decide what to do with
None

They agreed that for the time being they'd spend their evenings and weekends packing and organizing everything, and would ask for help moving things when they began to get things ready to move into their new place
None

They also wanted to give their new place some life, instead of keeping all of the plain white walls, so that was added to the list of 'to-dos' before everything their stuff was moved in.

None

...

None

The first three weeks of March were pretty uneventful and quiet for the families, Glee club students and their parents.

None

Deborah and Ethan's family members that didn't live in Lima, found out within the first week of March and everyone was excited to add another girl to the family and looked forward to meeting her.

None

March first, Abby was officially ten months old and Rachel made sure within that first week, she took pictures, much like they'd done a few months prior and she couldn't wait until her studio was complete.

None

New Directions worked on their songs for Nationals and the guys continued to keep their song choice and choreography from the girls, meeting during part of their lunch break a few times a week to practice
None

The girls, even though they were curious, honored their wishes and didn't try to figure it out; but they were looking forward to finding out what song it was.

None

Ethan and Puck had a few hockey games to attend and also began the construction on the garage
None

Knowing what they were doing and having everything already purchased to do it, they figured it'd be done before Nationals
None

They spent almost every night and some of their weekends working on it and only took a break one weekend, to join David, Alan, Ben, Burt, Finn and some other guys from the Glee Club, to help paint various rooms in David and Alan's new place.

None

While the guys spent time working on painting, the girls spent time trying to come up with costumes for Nationals and also working on planning the two events coming up in the next few weeks: a big baby shower for Deborah and Ethan, on the last Saturday of March, and a reception for Carole and Burt one day during Spring Break, after Nationals, because they were going to get married while their kids were out of school for Spring Break.

With just under two weeks before the Glee Club members would head to Detroit for Nationals, the guys were finally ready to show the girls what they'd been working on for almost a month.

None

It was a Monday, and the club had been meeting in the auditorium to practice on stage, and after they'd gone through their ballad and Quinn and Rachel's duet, the girls took seats with their directors in the front few rows of the auditorium
director has no Synonyms in the API
['take', 'seat', 'with', 'director']

As soon as the music began, all of the girls recognized it as a song from one of the High School Musical movies, but the choreography was completely original
None

Everyone enjoyed their performance and gave them a standing ovation when they finished, and everyone went up on stage to congratulate them and talk about it.

None

What made you pick that song? Rachel asked.

None

It was Puck's idea, Finn commented, motioning to him.

None

Puck shrugged, I thought it was a neat song in the movie and figured that we should go out with a bang, you know? Matt, Mike, Finn, Ryan and I are done after this, aside from all those school performances like we did last year and it's not something we've done before
bang has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'bang']

Usually all our routines are couples dancing or something traditional for a show choir and there's nothing in the rule book that says we can't do this
None

Matt and Mike did an awesome job choreographing and hopefully it'll help us stand out from everyone else.

None

It definitely does
None

Matt, Mike, you did amazing on the choreography
None

I know you've helped us in the past, but this was awesome to see it all done by you, Rachel commented.

None

Thanks, Mike smiled and Matt nodded in agreement, it was fun
None

It was nice to finish the year with something we did.

something has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm very proud of you all and it's not going to be the same without everyone together next year
None

We'd love to have you guys come back and visit and I don't know what your plans are, but Matt, Mike, after this, you could help choreograph our other performances, Will offered, Seniors, what are your plans? I know Puck is joining the Navy, but what about the rest of you? Will wondered, realizing they'd never talked about it.

None

I'm going to OSU here in Lima, Quinn said, but I'm not sure what I'm going to get for a degree.

None

Me too, Ryan commented, nodding at Quinn.

None

Same here, so I'll definitely be around to help out, Matt replied.

None

I'm not going to college, Finn said, I actually really like helping Burt out at the garage when I get free time and I think I'm going to do it full-time after I graduate.

None

My parents really want me to get a business degree, so I can take over running their various businesses around town, but I'm not sure I want to do that, Mike admitted, glancing at his sister Tina, but until I figure it out, I'm going to OSU here in Lima, too, so I'll be around.

None

We're all going to miss you in the club and at school, but we're glad we'll be able to see you around, Rachel smiled at them, already knowing of Quinn's decision to stay in Lima.

None

Quinn nodded in agreement, we'll definitely be around, she assured her, and besides, someone's gotta keep an eye on you while Puck's gone, she added with a wink.

Rachel blushed, leaning against her boyfriend, I think..
None

I'll miss him, but I think I'll be okay to handle it, she admitted, looking at Puck.

None

I hope so, but I appreciate that our friends are gonna still be around to help you out, Puck said, smiling at everyone.

None

That's what friends are for, Finn replied patting Puck on the shoulder.

As the week continued, the Glee Club members continued to practice, wanting to polish up their routines for Nationals, but towards the end of the week, Rachel, Puck, Kurt, Finn, Quinn, Jessica and some of their parents were helping put the finishing touches on plans for the baby shower on Saturday.

None

Traditionally a baby shower was for women; female women in the soon-to-be mom's life, but because Ethan and Deborah hadn't had a child in years, and because of Ethan's family missing a lot from the years of no-contact with Deborah, Puck and Arin, they planned to make the shower for family and friends, inviting everyone important in Ethan and Deborah's lives.

None

They also decided to do the shower at Deborah and Ethan's house, so by Friday evening and Saturday morning, everyone was pitching in to decorate their place in pinks and purples, in honor of their baby girl.

None

The shower was simple, like they wanted, but gave them an opportunity to celebrate their new child with their friends and family

All of Ethan's family came down from Northern Ohio, Ethan's former team and their families, along with his current team and their families came over
None

Deborah's siblings and their families all came, plus former and current coworkers
None

Rachel's dads, Carole and Burt, Will and Emma, and other friends of the couple, Glee Club members and Cheerios came over for a while, dropping off gifts and mingling.

None

The gifts had been opened and piled in the room they'd chosen as the nursery, but nothing had been put together yet; Puck and Ethan were waiting until the garage remodel was done to do the nursery.

None

Some of their guests didn't stay too long, but others stayed most of the day and Ethan and Deborah promised that once the baby was born, they'd have another party to introduce her to everyone.

None

As the evening rolled around and the last of their guests had left, leaving their few close friends and family members who lived locally, Deborah and Ethan deemed the party a success
None

They had a great time celebrating the new addition with their family and looked forward to meeting her when she arrived, sometime in May.

None

It had been a big, eventful day and everyone was tired, so they put aside the big clean up until the next day, Ethan and Puck promising to help before they went up to Detroit for one of the last hockey games they had tickets for.

None

...

None

Getting back to school on Monday, after a big weekend, the Glee Club was down to crunch time
None

They all were pitching in to help make sure everyone had their costumes together, to make sure their songs were polished and everyone had their permission slips in and enough chaperones for the amount of students going.

None

On top of the school activities, Ethan and Puck were putting the finishing touches on Rachel's studio
None

Most of the work they had to do, aside from putting up a few walls, was some simple things
None

It wasn't a huge space, so with all the time they'd worked on it, two to three hours a night and on some of their weekends, they were happy to say it was complete a few days before Nationals and were ready to show Rachel.

Puck wanted to keep it a surprise and Rachel decided to she wanted that, too, so she had only seen the doorway, in the space that had once been a garage door, filling in the extra space with opaque glass to give the room some natural light.

None

After dinner, Wednesday evening, Puck guided Rachel out to the garage, with Deborah, Arin, Ethan, David, Alan, carrying Abby, and Kona right behind them.

Noah, is the blindfold really necessary? Rachel asked, a little embarrassed that she had one of his bandanas wrapped around her head.

None

Not really, but I wanna make sure you don't see anything until you're inside, he admitted, pausing in the doorway
None

Now, keep in mind the construction is done, but you'll need to make it your space, he added.

None

I know, Rachel nodded, that was always the plan
None

You guys would take care of making it useful and I'd bring in the stuff I need.

None

Puck smiled and reached to turn on the light, why don't you take a look, he suggested, resting his hands on her shoulders as everyone moved inside behind them.

None

Rachel took a deep breath and lifted the blindfold, allowing her eyes to adjust to the light
None

After a moment, she gasped, looking around and already feeling tears in her eyes as she realized just how real everything was, oh my! This is..
None

I..
None

She stepped forward and reached out, touching the light gray painted wall near her and then looked down to see the darker gray plush carpeting, I didn't even think about carpeting
None

I just figured we'd keep the cement floor..
None

This is all amazing, she looked around a little and then moved back to her boyfriend, wrapping her arms around him, thank you, she murmured, unable to hold back the tears.

None

You're worth it, babe, Puck smiled, returning her hug and pressing a kiss to her cheek, the color is okay?

None

Yeah, it's perfect, she nodded, pulling back to wipe her eyes and then went to Ethan to thank him with a hug, it's a neutral color, so it will work with anything I bring in, she admitted, thank you doing this, dad.

I think so, too, Rachel replied, pulling back and wiping her eyes as she looked around and noticed a door on the back wall, another exit door? She wondered.

None

Nope, Puck smirked, taking her hand and guiding her towards the door, apparently before I was born, there was a bathroom and the laundry room out here, but they'd taken it out to move the washer and dryer into the house, Puck explained, opening the door and showing her the small bathroom; perfect for someone to touch up make-up before having their photos taken or using the restroom during a long photo shoot.

None

Rachel's mouth fell open in shock and then smiled brightly, slipping her arm around her boyfriend's waist, this is perfect, she said again, you guys did an amazing job and it's exactly what I wanted
None

I never realized how much I loved photography until you pointed it out to me, she said looking at Puck as they walked back towards their family, I'm so glad you did, Noah
None

The more I take pictures and research it as a business, the more excited I get about getting started and really doing this for a living
None

I can work the hours I want, so it doesn't interfere with our family time, and we wouldn't need a baby sitter, because Abby can be in here with me.

time has no Synonyms in the API

Exactly, Puck nodded in agreement, but you've gotta promise me a couple of things, he replied, looking at her and resting his hands on her shoulders.

None

What's that? Rachel asked, looking at him curiously.

None

The easy one is that I want you to promise that when you take pictures, of Abby and our friends and family, that you're in some of them, too
None

Don't always hide behind the camera, he started.

None

I promise
None

I'll make sure I'm in some of them, she replied with a smile.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Good, Puck smiled and gathered his thoughts, the other important one is, he paused, taking a deep breath, if this turns out to be something that you don't want to do anymore, tell me
None

You're turning your hobby into something more, because you're really talented in it and I know you'll do great things, he smiled at her, then continued, I know joining the military wasn't planned when we first got together, but now we're a family and you've supported me joining and are willing to stay here with Abby, while I'm in the Navy
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

I love you so much and Abby and I are so lucky to have you in our lives
None

I don't think you will, but I don't want you to ever regret your decisions to stay and be part of our family or blame me for holding you back from your dreams
None

I know the next few years are going to be rough on all of us while I'm gone, so it won't always be good times, but in general, I want you to be happy with your choices and with our family and if you're not, promise me you'll tell me, so we can figure out how to make you happy, he told her seriously.

None

Tears welled up in Rachel's eyes as he spoke, understanding what he was talking about and knowing from past conversations why this was coming up
None

Gently taking his hands in hers, she squeezed them gently, I promise that I'll tell you if that ever happens, but I'm pretty sure it won't
None

I love you and I love Abby and that's not going to change
None

Every decision I've made, has made me happier than I was and I wouldn't trade our life together for anything
None

Being a mom and having an amazing boyfriend, who will one day be my husband, are dreams of mine, too
None

Those have come true, so you're not holding me back from my dreams; you've helped me achieve ones that I honestly never thought I'd be lucky enough to reach, she paused, feeling tears slip down her cheeks as she continued to hold his hands, we've talked about this before, but my feelings have remained the same
None

You and Abby make me happier than I have ever been, you're honest with me, you love me, you make me feel special, you're concerned about me and want me to be happy..
None

I will never regret my decision to stay here with our family, because being here is right where I want to be

Broadway isn't a dream of mine anymore, because my dreams have changed, she let go of his hands and motioned around to her soon-to-be photography studio, this is one of my new dreams, and I have you to thank for helping me see that I do have more talents, she smiled as he reached up and wiped her eyes and then she took his hands again, you're right, the next few years are going to be tough, but we'll get through it as a family and I've supported you because I want you to be happy, too, Noah
None

You deserve just as much happiness as I do and if joining the military will make you happy, which I can tell it does when you've talked about it, then I'm more than willing to support you and I promise that you have 

None

 to worry about
None

We'll all miss you like crazy, but we'll be okay

We'll see each other as often as possible and when you're done with the military, I'll be here when you get home, I promise

I love you, she said again, smiling at him through tears.

Puck's shoulders fell in relief and he let go of her hands, wrapping his arms around her waist and lifting her up as he hugged her tightly, I love you, too, he murmured, sorry to bring it up again, he added softly.

None

Rachel wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed a loving kiss to his lips, then gently pulled back, don't be sorry
None

You have every right to ask, but my answer is always going to be the same thing
None

I'm in this, she motioned between them, forever.

None

Me too, he assured her, smiling and kissing her again, before gently setting her back down on the carpeting.

None

The young couple had had their conversation in front of the family, totally oblivious of their audience, but between the emotions of the moment and hormones, Deborah couldn't help choking out a sob, this makes me so happy
None

You're so wonderful together, she admitted, tears falling from her eyes.

None

Puck turned to look at Deborah as he slipped an arm around Rachel's shoulders, it makes me really happy, too, he said, glancing at Rachel.

None

It does, Rachel agreed, and I'm glad you all heard that, because I want you all to know how strong our feelings are.

None

We never doubted that, David commented, and Alan nodded in agreement.

None

It's very obvious you two are in it for the long haul, which we're all happy about, Ethan added, rubbing Deborah's back.

None

Puck watched Rachel move to get Abby from Alan, then returned to stand next to him, so he wrapped his arms around his girls and smiled, I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.

None

Rachel looked at Abby, then to their family, before turning her eyes to him and smiling, we're all very lucky.

None

...

None

Even if Puck hadn't said it directly, Rachel knew that one of his biggest fears was that she'd change her mind and leave him and Abby
None

She was happy to continue to assure him she'd never do that; she loved them too much to walk away, but that night, once everyone had left, Abby was asleep for the night and they were getting into bed themselves, she had something she wanted to ask him.

None

Noah, don't get me wrong, I love you and I'll continue to reassure you that I won't leave, but do you think you'll ever be able to fully believe me when I tell you I'm staying? She asked softly.

None

Puck blushed, expecting her to bring that up, yes, he nodded, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her close to him, I know we've talked about it before and every time we do, I'm less and less worried
None

Bringing it up tonight, helped get rid of the last bit of fears I had, he explained, and I'm sorry I kept bringing it up, he added.

None

It's okay, she kissed him, I understand why you're concerned and you have every right to ask, she shifted under the blankets to crawl on top of him, but I promise I'm not going anywhere.

None

Unable to help the reaction to her being that close, Puck groaned, I believe you, babe, he smiled, wrapping his arms around her body.

None

Rachel shifted slightly and pressed another kiss to his lips, good, because I have plans for our future.

None

Oh yeah? He raised a curious eyebrow at her, what kind of plans?

None

Well, in the very near future I plan for us to make love, but if you want to know about years from now..
None

You'll just have to wait and see, she winked deviously, but I promise, it'll be worth the wait.

None

Puck grinned and with one arm around her body, he used the other to help them flip over, letting her settle against the pillows as he hovered over her, I guess we'll just have to make the most out of right now and take the future as it comes, he replied gently.

The intimate moment between the couple helped them seal their promise, savoring the precious time together

It had been a busy and stressful few weeks and they knew it would only continue through the next few months, as the school year came to a close and things changed within their immediate family with the addition of a new baby

They'd found that some nights, one or both of them was just too tired to do anything, so they settled to just sleep in the same bed, but the times they could

The next day, Thursday and last day of March, was the last chance for the Glee Club to practice for Nationals
None

They were leaving the following morning to head back to Detroit for their final competition with the original members, because this year they had Seniors who'd be graduating in a few months; something they didn't have to deal with the year before.

year has no Synonyms in the API
None

Practicing their numbers a few times during lunch and after school, the club spent some time making sure everything was ready and everyone knew when to be at McKinley the next day to catch the bus.

None

Since Nationals, the year before, had been in Seattle, Washington, only the students and their chaperones had gone
None

This year, because it was only a few hours away in Detroit, some of the parents were also going, not just as chaperones, so not everyone would be riding on the bus and Will and the other directors made sure to reserve some extra rooms for the others coming.

None

This trip, instead of David and Alan staying in Lima and taking care of Abby and maybe Arin, they were all going along
None

David and Alan wanted to see them perform and Susan would have watched Abby and Arin, but she and Hannah were also going on the trip with Ben and Jessica, so Abby and Arin would be joining their parents on the trip.

None

Friday morning, though mostly packed and ready the night before, was still quite busy for the Puckerman and Berry families
None

It was the first overnight trip they'd taken with Abby, so they were all helping make sure everything had gotten finished and they had everything needed for the weekend away.

You know, I hate to burst your bubble, but people have babies in Michigan, too, Puck commented, seeing Rachel pacing around the kitchen, collecting bottles and other items for Abby, who was already dressed and back to sleep in her car seat, so I'm sure dad could go to the store, since he does know his way around Detroit, and get whatever we need, if we do forget something, he added, laughing lightly.

None

I'm well aware of that, Rachel replied, pausing what she was doing, but this is the first overnight trip we've taken with Abby and I want to make sure things go smoothly
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

I don't want anyone to have to make a special trip to the store or anything, unless it's absolutely necessary, because this isn't just a family vacation; it's a school trip and a Glee competition
None

With all the new members, who I know have said they don't care, I can't help worrying they're going to think we're getting special treatment or something
None

Last year, we only had the original members, plus two new ones, and they were all supportive of us having our own room, but with the new ones, this year, I still haven't quite figured everyone out and I have to work with them next year, too.

Puck moved over to his girlfriend and wrapped his arms around her, pressing a kiss to her cheek, it'll be fine
None

Yeah, I get things are different than they were last year, but we're not the only ones who will have families there, it's just that your dads, Abby, you and I are all getting one room, so we can be with Abby, while my parents help out with being chaperones for the others, he explained, and it doesn't matter what the other group members think.

abby has no Synonyms in the API

Rachel pulled back a little and glared at him, yes it does, she replied, trying not to snap, if they don't think it's right, they could tell their parents when they get home and then their parents could report it to Figgins
None

Hopefully the rest will continue to understand, but what if they don't? And Noah, we've never gone anywhere overnight with Abby before, so this is a big deal
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

With it being for a competition, another reason I'm a little nervous is because I don't want people to worry that we're distracted and not giving a hundred-percent to our performances.

None

Babe, we know every song by heart, we know the dances, we're not going to forget or be that distracted
None

We've already talked to everyone and the ones who don't have parents joining us are fine with what we're doing, so they're not going to complain and even if they do, Mr
None

Schue already got permission from Figgins for us to share a room, so relax, he explained softly, and as for this being our first trip with Abby, yes, it is a big deal, but we have our parents with us to help take care of her, so when we do need to focus on Glee, we can
None

We have a travel playpen we're taking that doubles as a crib that she can sleep in at night, we've got plenty of clothes packed for her, along with blankets, bottles, you've already packed her food and formula, so I don't understand why you're digging out more
None

I swear half of her nursery is in our bags, so I know we have plenty of diapers and the stuff to change her with
None

Things will be fine, he promised.

None

But what if she doesn't do well in the car? She's never spent that long in her car seat at one time and..
None

and what if Kona doesn't like being home alone? What if she doesn't like Burt coming over to check on her? Rachel wondered, concerns surfacing that she hadn't thought of before.

None

Abby is going to sleep the whole trip, I'm sure, because it's so early, he assured her, and as for Kona, she'll also be fine
None

She's familiar with Burt and he's going to stop in at least three times a day to make sure she's alright, feed her and let her out for a while, so she won't be alone all the time and we're only going to be gone about three days, he explained, rubbing her back gently, so relax
None

I get that you're concerned, but everything is going to work out.

None

Rachel took a deep breath and nodded, trying to relax, but being excited for their performances and the trip, made her even more concerned about wanting things to be perfect, alright, alright
None

I'm trying, she sighed, settling against his chest.

None

Puck nodded, good
None

So what's with this stuff? He motioned to where a bottle was sitting with another jar of food and some more things, some like what she'd already packed.

stuff has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'stuff']

I wanted to put a small bag together to have right with us in the car, that way if she does wake up before we get there, we have some things to feed her with, so we don't have to dig through all of our bags for everything we've packed, Rachel explained.

None

Feeding her in the car is probably not the best idea
None

Aside from it being messy, we don't know if she's gonna get car sick, so maybe water and a bottle of formula, but nothing else until we get to the hotel, Puck suggested, kissing her forehead.

None

Oh, I didn't think of that, she admitted, blushing.

None

It's alright
None

Two heads are sometimes better than one, he smiled at her, what time were your dads getting here?

None

They said around six
None

It should be plenty of time to pack everything up in their SUV and get to school to meet everyone, she replied, biting her lip, are you sure Kona's gonna be okay while we're gone.

None

Yes, Puck nodded, she will be
None

We've already got food and water down for her and she's been out
None

She knows something's going on, but she's used to us being gone for the morning and afternoons
None

The nights might be a little confusing, but she knows we always come back.

None

Rachel nodded and took another calming breath, okay
None

I'll try to relax.

None

Good, he smiled, because it's gonna be a fun trip.

None

I hope so, she agreed, it's our last one together
None

I hate thinking about it, but it's true.

None

Puck rested a hand against her cheek and leaned in, pressing a kiss to her lips, I know, he nodded, taking a deep breath, it sucks, but the best part is that we're not over
None

We'll always have the memories from Glee, even if we're not together and I'll try my best to come see you guys perform, he explained.

None

Rachel smiled at him, nodding at his suggestion, that would be wonderful
None

If you can't make it, I can always get you a video, she added, and you're right
None

We won't be over.

None

Exactly.

None

...

None

As planned, David and Alan arrived at Puck and Rachel's house just before six and immediately, the three dads, Puck, David and Alan began helping pack everything into their SUV
None

Around the same time they were packing their cars, Ethan was doing the same thing and they could see Finn and Burt loading Kurt's SUV down the street.

None

Burt couldn't get away from the garage that weekend, since he was taking the whole following week off to get married and be with his family, so Carole was going with Quinn, Finn and Kurt
family has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'family']

Seeing Puck outside, Burt walked down to him and then went inside, not only to see Kona to remind her who he was, but also to make sure he knew where her food and things were in the house.

None

He was only there a short time and once he left, the Berrys and Puckermans took care of a few last minute details before they were finally ready to go
None

After making sure Abby and her car seat was buckled into the SUV correctly, Rachel and her dads stayed in the car, while Puck said 'goodbye' to Kona and locked up the house.

None

By the time they were on their way to McKinley, Puck's family was right behind them with Carole, Kurt, Quinn and Finn following a few minutes later
carole has no Synonyms in the API
None

When they got to McKinley, Ben and his family were also just arriving, and they all parked near the bus, where Will was standing, checking everyone in and some of the club members and chaperones were already on the bus
None

Will, the bus driver, Ethan, Alan, Carole, Ben and the other parents who were driving their own cars up to Detroit all gathered together to discuss the trip.

None

Everyone was glad that Ethan knew his way around and he agreed to take the lead
None

Just before seven, everyone who was coming along had arrived and it didn't take long before several cars and a school bus pulled out of the McKinley parking lot, all headed for Detroit.

None

...

None

The drive to Detroit was as uneventful as expected
None

The teens tried to relax or sleep as much as possible and like Puck had said, Abby did sleep the whole trip, only waking up when the car slowed down in the city limits of Detroit.

None

See, I told you she'd sleep the whole way, Puck smirked.

None

Rachel blushed, yes, you did
None

I hadn't thought about her sleeping the whole way up, she admitted, or I wouldn't have been so concerned.

None

Most babies like car rides because it helps calm them, David commented from the front seat.

None

Puck nodded, yeah, some nights it was the only way for mom to get Arin to sleep, he explained.

None

I forget sometimes that you helped raise your sister, Rachel said softly, letting Abby hold onto her finger.

None

It's okay
None

Sometimes I forget, too
None

I mean, I don't remember everything from when I was a kid, but some things
None

Once you learn, you don't forget the big stuff, Puck shrugged.

None

Yeah, that is true
None

And now you and your dad will have something else to bond over, Rachel replied.

None

What do you mean? Puck wondered.

None

He helped raise you until you were almost seven, but he missed all of the baby girl stuff with Arin
None

You're raising a little girl and they're having a girl, so now he is going to get that experience and you two can talk about it
None

I'm not saying you didn't have things to talk about before, but just something different
None

I've heard raising boys are different than raising girls, so with your experience with Arin, and now Abby, in a sense, you've got more knowledge than he does, Rachel explained, but I suppose he was around for his nieces when hey were growing up.

None

Puck nodded in understanding, yeah I get it and you're right
None

He probably was, but it's not the same as raising your own
None

Now dad is gonna get the first-hand experience that he missed with Arin and we'll be raising daughters within a year of age, so we'll be able to talk about things and compare notes
arin has no Synonyms in the API
None

That will be cool, Puck smiled, rubbing Abby's cheek a little as she looked around curiously
None

We also have two other dads to talk to about raising a girl, he glanced to the front of the car where David and Alan were.

None

We're definitely happy to help, if you ask, but we also don't want you guys to feel like we're trying to be know-it-alls, or something like that, Alan commented.

None

We won't think that, Puck promised, looking back at Abby and then letting her take hold of his finger like she was doing with Rachel's, the more I know, the more comfortable I feel about being a dad and I'm really glad to have parents to lean on, because if we didn't, I definitely wouldn't be this laid back about things.

rachel has no Synonyms in the API

Rachel looked at her boyfriend and then her dads, before turning her gaze to Abby, I agree
None

We definitely have a lot to be thankful for.

None

Just before ten, New Directions and their parents arrived at the same hotel they'd stayed at the last two times they'd been in Detroit, so everyone was familiar with it
None

Once they were checked in and room cards and assignments were handed out, the teens and adults slowly unpacked the bus and their cars and worked their way upstairs.

None

Puck, Rachel, Abby, David and Alan were staying in the same room, so Rachel took Abby and a few lighter bags, while the dads gathered their things and soon they were in their room, unpacking and setting up a few things for Abby
None

She was hungry, so Rachel and Puck both worked on getting her breakfast and taking care of her, I'm so glad we were all able to come this year, Rachel admitted, as she held up the baby spoon to Abby and she took it into her mouth
None

Last year, Seattle was beautiful, but it's so far from home.

None

It was, Puck agreed, keeping his mouth shut about exactly what happened a year prior, not wanting Rachel to worry about it, if she hadn't thought of it
None

What time do we perform today? Puck asked her.

None

Mr
None

Schuester said we go on at three
None

I don't know how we're going to work this with Abby needing a nap today, Rachel admitted, because we get our practice room at noon, like last time and perform at three
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

she added.

None

We were going to stay here, David commented, and let her have a nap and then head over around two.

None

Oh, I suppose that could work
None

I just thought everyone would go to the venue together, Rachel replied.

None

So when we all go down to get on the bus, we can talk about it then, Puck glanced at his watch, Mr
None

Schue wanted us down there at eleven-thirty, so we have time to figure it out, he suggested.

None

Alright, Rachel nodded.

None

...

None

Getting a chance to relax for a short time, soon the teens and some of their directors were climbing onto the bus to the venue
None

Ethan led them there in his SUV, but then returned to the hotel, so when the rest of the adults and families that had come along were going to the venue, he could show them the way.

None

Checking in and heading right to their practice room, the teens ran through their numbers, for that day a few times, before starting to get ready
None

A little after two, the rest of the parents, Arin, Hannah and Abby arrived, wishing the teens good luck and when the club headed down to the stage, most of their parents went off to find seats to watch from the front, while the directors stayed on the side.

None

You ready? Puck asked curiously, glancing at Rachel.

None

Yes, are you? She wondered, squeezing his hand as they stood next to each other, watching the team before them finish up.

None

Puck nodded, I am
None

We're gonna kick some ass, he grinned.

None

Rachel smiled, I think we are, too.

None

...

None

When McKinley's turn finally came, the teen couple got ready to start their ballad
None

They were going to be entering the stage from opposite sides, so Rachel walked down to the other end and Puck signaled the band after Rachel nodded at him that she was ready.

None

As the music began, Puck stepped out, immediately beginning the song, 

None

 he sang, slowly walking towards the center of the stage.

None

Rachel took her cue and stepped out from the curtain as his words ended and she picked up with the next lines, 

line has no Synonyms in the API
['pick', 'with', 'line']

 she walked towards him
None

Reaching her boyfriend, she took his hands and they stood facing each other, singing the next few lines together, 

None

 Puck paused to let her continue, 

None

 she sang, and Puck joined her for the last line of the chorus, 

None



None

The two broke their hands apart as the music slowed again and they stepped a few feet apart and Rachel sang the beginning of the next chorus, 

None

 she sang motioning above towards the lights, 

None

 the two sang together, before Rachel added, 

None

 and Puck echoed her words, before they continued together, but also walked towards the sides of the stage, 

None

 even though they were apart, they turned to face each other on opposite sides of the stage as they began walking back together, 

None

 they sang together and Puck smiled, then continued with a few words, 

word has no Synonyms in the API
None

 before they met again, joining hands together to finish the second verse, 

None



None

As Rachel and Puck finished their words, the other members began filing onto the stage, taking places in specific spots
None

Puck reached up resting a hand on Rachel's cheek and smiled at her, giving her a silent promise that those words were not just part of the song to him; he meant them
None

The moment only lasted a few seconds, but Rachel returned his smile and the two moved to take their places in the front of the club
None

On cue, the whole group began with some vocal runs, Rachel and Puck echoing words of the chorus to each other every few moments
run has no Synonyms in the API
['begin', 'with', 'run']

At the end, Puck and Rachel joined hands again and sang the last line together as the club stopped, 

None



None

The band stopped at the same moment their words did and the venue erupted into applause
None

The club members bowed together in thanks and waved at the audience, then everyone dashed off stage as the lights dimmed a little, preparing for their second song of the day.

None

Once backstage, the guys quickly took off their black dress shirts and red ties, handing them off to their girlfriends, friends or their chaperones, leaving them in red 'McKinley Titans' t-shirts, their black jeans and a pair of black and white Converse
None

To finish off their new 'costume' they wrapped white bandanas around their foreheads and gathered together at the side, motioning to the band to start.

None

With final words of luck sent their way, the guys headed out on the stage, using the beat of the music to get there
None



None

 Puck sang, glancing at Finn, who continued, 

None



None



None

 The guys all sang the bridge, following Mike and Matt's choreography without missing a beat
None

Most of the time they were doing the same moves, but sometimes half of them would do something opposite, but it'd come back together to match again, using some hip-hop dance steps; something they hadn't seen much of during any of their show choir competitions.

None

Reaching the chorus, the guys all continued, 

None



None

Keeping up with the dance, Puck started the next verse, 

dance has no Synonyms in the API
['keep', 'with', 'dance']

 Finn took over the next few lines, 

None

 He sang, and then Puck and the rest of the guys joined him to sing the bridge again, 

None



None

After one more time through the chorus, the guys stopped singing, but kept dancing for a few moments, then picked up the chorus twice more
None

At the end of the chorus again, the music stopped, the guys froze on the stage and Puck and Finn stood back to back and sang the last lines of the song, 

None



None

The lights dimmed and the audience cheered even louder than before, and then the guys bowed and waved, before jogging off the stage, definitely worn out from the upbeat dance they'd just done.

None

Congratulating them as soon as they got backstage, Rachel immediately dashed to her boyfriend, and threw her arms around him, you all were amazing! She exclaimed, happily.

None

Thanks babe, he smiled, kissing her gently as he hugged her, hopefully it made us stand out so we can go on to the next round.

None

Well after the reaction by the audience, if we don't, I'd be very upset and surprised, Rachel admitted, as the club began to make their way towards their practice room.

None

...

None

The teens would have to wait until the next morning to find out if they'd move on to the second round; like at Regionals, they changed the schedule from the year before
None

Settling to waiting, everyone changed and congratulated each other, all of them hoping they'd be moving on.

None

In less than a half an hour, the large group was finally ready to leave, so they slowly moved out of the room and made their way towards the exit, where they were going to meet their families
None

What they didn't expect was additions to the people they already knew where there
None

Ethan's former team, their families and some of Ethan's side of the family, including his mom, who was holding her great-granddaughter, and some of his siblings and their families.

None

Mom! Guys, what are you all doing here? Ethan asked totally surprised.

None

We came to support you all, Orla replied, stepping towards him with Abby in her arms
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

As soon as Abby saw her parents, she reached out for them, so Puck moved to them, taking Abby from his grandma and greeting her with a partial hug before stepping back to Rachel with Abby, we thought we'd come up to cheer you on
hug has no Synonyms in the API
abby has no Synonyms in the API

We haven't seen you perform since last June when you did that show at the school, so this is the first time we could see you all together and it's not every day one of my grandchildren performs for a National competition, well, technically I have two grandchildren performing, Orla glanced at Puck and Rachel, but I think you get what I mean, she explained.

None

Rachel smiled at her, yes, we do and thank you all for coming
None

We all appreciate it, she explained.

None

...

None

Though not all of the members knew everyone, they were all happy to have an audience to cheer them on and they hung out there for a short time, but soon everyone was making their way back to the hotel in cars or on the bus.

None

Some of the members and their parents or chaperones began heading out to find someplace for dinner
None

The Berrys, all of the Puckermans, Ethan's visiting family, his former team, Carole, Kurt, Quinn, Finn and some of the other Glee kids, piled into various cars and headed towards to the Mexican restaurant Deborah, Ethan, Puck, Rachel, Finn and Quinn ate at the very first time they were in Detroit, who was already expecting their large group and were happy to accommodate them.

None

With two long tables, the teens took one and settled around it, while the adults sat down at the other table, everyone talking and enjoying some time to just relax
None

No one had to worry about work or school, aside from the reason the Glee Club was there, and Puck got a chance to catch up with his cousins, aside from the short times they'd talked or exchange messages online or when they saw each at his parent's baby shower.

cousin has no Synonyms in the API
['catch', 'with', 'cousin']

...

None

For several hours the large group talked and ate, relaxing and for the McKinley students, didn't worry about the results of the first round, even though all of them had it on their mind
None

Everyone was happy to have something to do to pass the time, but as it got later, people needed to start getting home or to their hotels
None

Ethan's family that had come up was staying at a hotel a few miles away and everyone there promised to return to the venue the next day for the results and hopefully a second performance for the club.

None

Heading back to the hotel to make sure everyone got back, the large group said their goodbyes and parted, leaving the Ohio students and their parents and chaperones at their hotel
None

Slowly the group filtered off into their rooms, saying 'goodnight' to their friends, knowing they had an early morning the next day.

None

David, Alan, Rachel, Noah and Abby, returned to their room along with Deborah, Ethan and Arin and spent some time as the small family, talking while everyone pitched in to help make sure they could get Abby settled for the night and then headed off to their rooms, agreeing to meet around eight in the morning for breakfast in the hotel's cafÃ©.

None

Once Deborah, Ethan and Arin left for the night, Puck, Rachel and Rachel's dads got ready for bed and even though they weren't in separate rooms, Puck had something he wanted to tell Rachel and he didn't mind that her dads heard, you know, I almost lost it on stage today, Puck admitted to Rachel as he crawled under the blankets.

None

Rachel thought back to their performance to see if she could pick it out and then realized when, at the end of 'Faithfully'?

None

Yeah, he nodded, I know it's about a singer touring and trying to have that life with a spouse and family at home, but I realized something a few weeks ago and decided to wait to say something..
spouse has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'life', 'with', 'spouse']

It's a metaphor for us
None

I'm gonna be gone a lot, and it's not usually the best life for a family and when we do see each other, we'll be like reacquainting ourselves with each other and our life, while I have a whole other life in the Navy, but no matter what, we'll be faithful to each other; I swear I will.

other has no Synonyms in the API

I believe you, Noah, and I promise I will be, too, Rachel smiled, pressing a kiss to his lips as she snuggled against him
None

And I thought of that a few weeks ago, too, and had the same feelings
None

I wanted to wait because I didn't want you to be distracted when we sang it.

None

Puck smiled, glad she believed him, I know you will be, he kissed her gently, and I love that we think the same way sometimes.

None

Me too, she agreed, I love you.

None

I love you, too, he replied, relaxing as he held her close to him.

None

None

Saturday morning, once everyone was up and had eaten breakfast in the cafÃ©, they piled onto the bus and into cars and headed over to the venue around nine, meeting Ethan's family and some of his former team.

None

Filing into the large space, they found seats all together in the audience, and soon the venue was filling up with groups and chaperones from all over the country, waiting to find out the top five schools who would be going on to the second round
group has no Synonyms in the API
['fill', 'with', 'group']

Just after ten-am, one of the female judges stepped onto the stage and like at every competition, they thanked everyone for coming and alphabetically announced the bottom ten schools who would not be performing again
None

McKinley was relieved to find out they'd made it to the second round and once the other schools had left, the judge started talking again
None

Congratulations for making it this far, she said, clapping and everyone there cheered
None

Once they were settled down again, she went on, as with most of our competitions, at this time, I'd tell you where you placed
None

As you know your round one scores, combined with your round two scores decides your final place
score has no Synonyms in the API
None

A school who makes it into fifth place in round one, could do amazing in the second round and their scores could bring them up to third place, for example, but a school who placed first or second might not put a hundred-percent into their performance, because they know they're on top, and it could cost them losing their place
None

With this in mind, the judges and I have decided that we will not be announcing your places, so everyone will be fighting equally for their spot
None

With that said, at eleven-am we will begin the second performances
None

We've randomly selected who will go on at what time and once you are done, be back here tomorrow at ten-am for the results, she explained, at eleven, Clinton High School will go on
None

At eleven-thirty will be William McKinley, followed by Lake Highlands at noon
None

At twelve-thirty, Malibu and lastly, at one will be Carmel.

None

Most everyone one was pissed at the change and others agreed with their choice, but no one had too long to complain
choice has no Synonyms in the API
None

Some of the schools were going on in a very sort time and had to change, so the groups, along with some of their chaperones headed to practice rooms and started changing into their costumes
None

McKinley had gone with simple jeans and t-shirts for their costume, so most of them had worn part or all of their costume to the venue, to save time on changing, giving them just enough time to run through their final song once more before they headed down to the stage, just as the previous year's first place winner, Clinton High School AttachÃ© was finishing up.

Right on time, once their band had gotten settled, the group walked out on stage and took their places as couples on stage
None

They were lucky enough to have an even amount of guys to girls, so they could do partner dancing for this sing, so once everyone was settled, Rachel signaled the band to start their final song
None

The whole group began with some repeating sounds in harmony between the guys and girls, before Rachel and Puck, holding hands, stepped forward like they'd practiced, beginning their choreography as Rachel started with the first verse and the bridge, 

sound has no Synonyms in the API

With their partner dancing, even though Rachel and Puck were at the front of the stage, they were doing the same as the rest, and the couple danced back to the group as everyone started signing the chorus, 

None

 they sang, continuing on with some similar harmonies from the beginning, helping show all of their vocal ranges.

harmony has no Synonyms in the API

Quinn and Finn stepped forward, just like Puck and Rachel had earlier, as Quinn began the second verse and repeated the bridge, 

None



None

Returning to their friends, the group began singing the chorus once more and at the end of it, Rachel sang, 

None

 She smiled at Puck, as everyone went on to sing the chorus again, with the band and even though the song wasn't over, the band stopped after chorus, allowing the group to sing the final chorus a cappella.

As they reached the end, Quinn and Rachel turned to their boyfriends and sang the last few words together,

When the lights went out on stage for the final time with the Seniors, the moment was bitter-sweet
None

The audience went crazy, cheering loudly for them, and the club thanked them by waving and bowing before heading backstage, but once behind the curtains, everyone began hugging each other, knowing it was their last competition all together
None

Holding all of their emotions in as best they could, they headed back to their practice room to change and it was then that several of the girls broke down, Rachel being one of them.

None

Puck was just as upset, but he tried to hold himself together for Rachel as she clung to him, crying, I know, babe, but it's okay, he murmured, rubbing her back.

None

But it's never going to be the same again, she replied softly.

None

Maybe not like this, but we'll always be friends of some sort and keep in touch with as many as we can
many has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's not like the Seniors and I are leaving and no one will ever see or hear from us again, he explained, his voice a little louder so everyone could hear.

None

He's right, everyone, Will said from nearby, and just because this is our final competition, doesn't mean it's over completely
None

We still are going to go to the middle schools like we did last year and do a show at school for the students and one in the evening for anyone who wants to come, he explained, and I was going to wait until we got back to school after Spring Break, but I'll let you guys know now
None

Figgins has asked us to perform at graduation's commencement ceremony.

None

Really? But what about us Seniors? Quinn asked, wiping her own eyes as she stood in Finn's arms.

None

We haven't worked out all the details, but we'll arrange it so the club can sit in one area, the Seniors can sit with the rest of their class, but you'll all be in one row of seats, so when it's our time to perform, you all can join us, Will told them, this is a big deal for all of you, because this is the first time the Glee Club will ever perform at graduation

It's all something we wanted to do, Will motioned to Deborah and Ethan, who'd been in Glee years prior, but we never got the chance
None

So it doesn't matter what we place now
None

We've made it this far as a team and it's not the end, he promised.

None

...

None

Will's announcement helped the teens relax and realize that even though it was their last competition, they still had several performances to go before it was really 'the end'
None

They even began brainstorming what songs, from the last two years, they'd want to sing for the trips to the middle schools, at McKinley and what 'graduation' or 'moving on' songs were out there to learn for the ceremony in June.

None

Missing Lake Highlands' performance, the teens rejoined everyone there cheering McKinley on and they all watched the final performances of Malibu High School and Vocal Adrenaline
None

Both teams were just as good as McKinley and everyone knew the judges would have a tough time deciding who the winner was, which is why they wouldn't find out until the next day.

None

Gathering up and making their way towards the exits, Ethan's former coworkers congratulated them all and left, knowing Ethan and Puck had plans for the rest of the day and in the next few months, they'd all be able to see each other, for weekend barbeques.

None

Of the tickets that Puck and Ethan had gotten for Father's Day the year before for the Detroit Red Wings, the last game they had happened to be that day, so while their friends and other chaperones and family members were hanging out, they were going to the game.

None

Ethan's family from Northern Ohio that had come up, was leaving later in the day, so once everyone returned to the hotel to change, some went out into town for lunch and to 'sight-see' a little, while others stayed at the hotel and for the first time, use the indoor, heated pool they had
None

The Puckermans, Berrys and Ballards spent most of their time in the hotel's cafÃ©, and soon Puck and Ethan were saying 'goodbye' to their relatives, knowing they'd be gone before they got back, and headed to the game.

None

...

None

Once Ethan and Puck had left, Ethan's family stuck around a while, but had to get going
None

They had only planned to stay one night, thinking the announcement for who won would be that day, so they hadn't reserved their rooms for a second night
None

Rachel and Deborah promised to let them know what they placed as soon as they found out and soon the Ballard family members were wishing them luck and saying 'goodbye', and then started their trip back to Ohio.

None

Abby had napped throughout the few hours they'd been in the cafÃ©, and as it got time for her to eat dinner, Rachel, Deborah, David and Alan went up to relax in their room, while Arin hung out with Ben and Susan's daughter

Getting Abby fed and settled into her playpen the family took the time to enjoy the downtime, knowing the rest of the week, even though the teens were out of school for Spring Break, would be busy.

None

...

None

Puck and Ethan got back from the game around nine-thirty and found their families in Puck's room that he was sharing with Abby, Rachel and her dads
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

The guys talked a little about the game and how the Wings had won, before they separated for the night to meet back up the next morning.

None

Though not needing to pack that night, everyone started to, knowing after the announcements they'd have a short time to come back to pack before leaving and they didn't want to rush the next day.

None

When morning arrived everyone was up early again and after breakfast in the cafÃ©, they piled on the bus and into cars and a little after nine-am, they were on their way back to the venue for the final time
None

Now that there was only five schools, it was a lot less crowded and they found seats near the stage and settled to wait for the judges again.

None

Just after ten, the same judge from the day before moved up onto the stage, where a large table was sitting with five trophies and five plaques, each trophy being larger depending on the place they were for
trophy has no Synonyms in the API
None

She started talking again and asked for a representative for each school to come up on stage, so Will went up for New Directions, along with Shelby for Vocal Adrenaline and the other teams directors
None

At first, the plaques were given out for the ranks from round one
None

Malibu High School took fifth, Lake Highlands took fourth, Vocal Adrenaline took third, McKinley was second and AttachÃ© was first
None

Brief celebrations and cheering from all the schools went on as their directors got the plaques

None

After getting everyone settled down, the judge announced who officially placed fourth and fifth, the same schools as from the first round, so once their directors had gotten their trophies and shook hands with all the judges, they left the stage leaving Shelby, Will and one other director up there
judge has no Synonyms in the API
['shake', 'hand', 'with', 'judge']

In a surprising twist, AttachÃ© too third place, a huge change from winning the competition the year before and taking first place in the first round
None

Disappointed, but understanding, the director accepted the trophy and returned to his team, leaving Will and Shelby standing on the stage.

None

We're left with two schools from Ohio state

Last year, newcomer to the competitions, New Directions from William McKinley High School took second place, while Carmel High School's Vocal Adrenaline took third; a team with multiple first place trophies under their belt
None

Inside this envelope, I have the winner, she paused, opening it up, more for show than anything, since she already knew who it was
None

...and the winner of the '2010 to 2011 School Year National Show Choir Competition is..

- Rachel and Quinn sang 'You're My Number One' by S Club 7

I love their music
None

I'd had this song picked out for weeks before writing this chapter (in mid-March), and as I was finishing up with the guys performance and went online to look up the lyrics for this song, I was also was on Tumblr and one of the people I follow posted a tweet about S Club 7 getting back together, signing a new two album record deal! This is so very cool! Perfect timing for them to sing this song!

My doctor is pretty sure it's gallbladder and I knew going to the doctor last week that it probably was, too, but my ultrasound results were 'normal', so now I have to go to a specialist to see if they can figure it out

The location of the abdominal pain I'm having and all the symptoms point to gallbladder and even though the ultrasound was normal, I know people who've had two or three ultrasounds before they found a gallbladder problem, so it still probably is

A/N5: (This note was written in mid-March, before all the spoilers for the season 3 finale came out, so a portion of this doesn't pertain to Glee now, but I just wanted to mention it anyway.) A subject was brought up in this chapter that I wanted to address
None

I'm well aware, because I've watched Glee's season 3, that since Finn proposed to Rachel and she said 'yes', a lot of people are concerned that the Glee writers are going to have her stay in Lima and give up her dreams for a guy she thinks she loves
None

I am concerned, too, because Finn is a horrible boyfriend to Rachel and she deserves so much more than what he gives her..
None

I really don't think I could say anything extremely nice about season 3, so I'm not going to say any more..
None

What I do want to bring up is that this story and the direction it began taking was 

None

 back when late-season 1 of Glee was airing, 

None

 before Glee took this horrible direction with a certain pairing
pairing has no Synonyms in the API
['take', 'direction', 'with', 'pairing']

At the time, a lot of people were writing future fics, where Rachel goes off to Broadway and I just wanted to do something different; to show Rachel and Puck in a truly caring relationship and having Rachel realizing that she loves being a mom and being with him, that her dreams can change over time and there is more to her life than just being on Broadway
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I don't regret, for one second, the direction this story has taken, and I'm going to continue to write it this way
None

Part of the reason I wanted to address this, is because I don't want to get 'hate' messages saying that I'm being a hypocrite by writing a fic where Rachel stays in Lima, while hating that it might happen in Glee..
None

It's two completely different reasons and after so many chapters written, where this has been the plan all along, I don't want to just change it and send Rachel to New York
None

It doesn't fit with the direction of this story and I know on Glee, continuity doesn't mean a whole lot, but to me, it's important
direction has no Synonyms in the API

A/N3: 

None

 This chapter was written in late-March / early-April 2012, before Glee returned from it's hiatus and way before 'Props' and 'Nationals' aired
None

I had no clue that New Directions would really win Nationals, which aired only a few hours after I posted the previous chapter, where the teens won at Nationals in both my fic and the show
None

New Directions has been my plan since I wrote the last Nationals in this fic, so I was shocked! Also, when Glee returned from it's hiatus and we learned in 'Big Brother' that the winners of Nationals get $10,000 for their school
None

I liked that, so I decided to add it in
None

It's the 

None

 thing from season 3 that I've used, so far..
None

I 

None

 borrow some of the song choices from the finale to include in my 'graduation' chapter, but I don't know if I will..
None

In the show, New Directions, or more specifically Puck and Finn, perform at graduation
None

For two years, I've had planned, that New Directions would perform at graduation, so again, I was shocked I had similar ideas to the show, but the show's graduation, to me, was unrealistic
None

I'm going to make it more real, similar to the experience I had when I graduated from high school 10 years ago...

None

...

None

A range of emotions washed over the teens of New Direction as they were announced the winners
None

All of them jumped up from their seats in happiness, but tears came to the eyes of many of the girls, while the guys cheered and fist bumped their friends nearby and some of the teens remained in shock for a long moment, the news taking longer to sink in.

None

We won! Rachel exclaimed, jumping at her boyfriend and throwing her arms around his neck.

None

Puck pressed a kiss to her lips as he wrapped his arms around her body, holding her close, we did, he nodded, smiling brightly, it had to be your duet with Quinn yesterday that did it, he added proudly.

None

Rachel blushed a little, fighting back tears she knew would start falling soon, maybe, but it also could have been your amazing routine with the guys on Friday, she replied, but at the moment, all that matters is that we won as a team..
guy has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'guy']

That we were all together for it.

None

Agreed, he smiled, I'm glad the Seniors and I got to be a part of this.

None

The brunette nodded, tears escaping from her eyes as she stretched up and kissed him, I feel the same way.

None

None

When Will returned to the team, everyone crowded around him to get a look at their large trophy, but the teens and their directors were wanted on stage for a few photos, so they all started to move toward the stage
None

Shelby, Rachel's two friends from Vocal Adrenaline and a few others congratulated them as they walked by and Rachel promised Kelly, Angela and Shelby that she'd get in touch with them in the very near future to talk when they had more time.

None

Once New Directions and their four directors were on stage, the judges greeted them all and congratulated them before the large cardboard check was brought out, written out to them, for ten-thousand dollars
None

The prize money wasn't something talked about too much
None

Everyone had been focused on their performances and the club wasn't 'hurting' for money like they had been when Will first took over
None

A large portion of the money that used to go to the Cheerios, now went to New Directions, so they had a decent amount of cash flow, to help them out with costumes, bus money and lodging for trips, but they also were happy to have won the money and knew it would definitely help out in the future.

The Show Choir Board wanted to present the judges with the check, so the teens stood off to the side and Will, Ben, Ethan and Deborah stood under the large 'Nationals' banner hanging above the stage
check has no Synonyms in the API
['present', 'judge', 'with', 'check']

The judges walked up and one of them handed over the check and Will shook his hand, everyone turned to the photographer.

None

New Directions cheered as their directors got the check and when the photographer had a few photos of them, he called over the teens and they all began to find places to stand on the risers so they could all be seen
None

Setting the trophy in the front of them and having a few in the front row hold the check, with the Nationals banner behind them, the photographer took a few shorts of just the teens, then their coaches joined them for another few, before the judges stepped into one side of the group for a few final shots
banner has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'few', 'with', 'banner']

When the photographer was taking pictures, a few of the teen's parents were also doing that, to have extra photos from the trip
None

Once the official photographer was finished, everyone was free to leave, but the teens and adults stuck around to get more pictures together, groups of friends, couples and families standing together, under the Nationals banner, to keep memories from the competition.

None

Knowing they couldn't stay forever, reluctantly everyone gave in and gathered their things after a while and made their way towards their bus and waiting cars
None

Returning to their hotel, the Ohio residents finished packing their bags and by two that afternoon they were checking out of their hotel and driving towards the nearest fast food place to get food to eat on the way home.

None

...

None

Leaving Detroit after a stop for lunch, everyone was excited to get home and start their Spring Break
None

Just like on their trip north, their return to Lima was uneventful and Abby slept the whole way
None

Even though several parents had brought their cars and their kids were with them, Will still wanted everyone to meet at McKinley first, just to make sure everyone got home, since it was still a school trip
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Pulling into the school's lot, the bus stopped by the sidewalk and the car drivers found parking spots near the bus and everyone climbed out to stretch their legs; glad to be home
None

Several parents were gathered nearby, waiting to pick up their kids, so the group from the cars made their way towards them, and immediately the parents began congratulating the teens as they started getting off the bus.

None

For a short time, the large group chatted about the trip and the guys helped Ben, Will and Ethan take some of the instruments back into the choir room
None

Once the bus was emptied and double checked, it left and slowly the members and their parents started leaving the school
None

Some of them who were going away on vacation wished everyone a fun break and others promised to see each other during the week, most of them attending Carole and Burt's reception in a few days and some were going to help David and Alan move; something they hadn't started yet.

None

Most of the original members were still there, waiting for the guys to finish their trip into the school and once they joined them, they all got a chance to take a break
None

This was a shorter trip than last year, but it was definitely worth it, Will admitted.

None

Yes it was, Rachel nodded, I'm so glad we all could be a part of this win
None

Next year we'll only have half of our original members and it wouldn't be the same to win without you all, she admitted, knowing all of the Seniors were standing in the group.

None

Rachel! Don't jinx us for next year, Tina told her, laughing lightly.

None

I'm not trying to, Rachel blushed, shifting Abby in her arms a bit, I don't know if we're going to win next year or not, but if we do, and hadn't this year, it would be weird knowing that we won without those who had graduated.

None

I get what you mean, Quinn admitted, we see it every year on the Cheerios
None

It sucks losing members and then taking a higher place at competition than the year before and wondering just what changed
None

Trying to figure out of it was the people or the routine or a little of both that gave us the upper hand, she explained.

None

Exactly, Rachel nodded.

None

Quinn was about to say something, but was interrupted by her phone beeping
None

That's odd, she admitted, pulling her phone from her pocket to stop the noise and then gasped at what was on her screen.

None

What's wrong? Finn asked, trying to glance at it over her shoulder.

None

I..
None

I set the alarm almost a year ago, because I didn't want to forget, but I guess with all the emotions from winning today I did, she whispered, glancing at Abby and then to Ethan, today's 

emotion has no Synonyms in the API
None

 anniversary.

None

What? Rachel asked and then her eyes widened, instinctively holding Abby a little tighter.

None

Puck wrapped an arm around Rachel's shoulders, his hand gently resting on Abby's back, where she was snuggled against Rachel, I remembered a few days before we went to Nationals.

None

Rachel looked at him, why didn't you say anything?

None

I didn't want you to be distracted, Puck admitted, it was already a big trip and I didn't want our last competition together to have a dark cloud hanging over it.

None

That's the same reason why I didn't bring it up
None

It's one thing to know and remember it happened, but it's in the past and we're all okay now, Ethan explained, we've also all moved on and don't need to dwell on the 'what ifs'.

None

Quinn bit her lip and nodded at Ethan's words, then took a deep breath, yeah, I guess you're right, she agreed, but I still want to thank you
None

You held me together and saved my life and Abby's, she said, motioning to Abby in Rachel's arms, I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't been there.

None

Ethan walked over to Quinn and wrapped his arms around her in a friendly hug, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat, he promised
None

And you don't need to think about that 'what if', because I was there, he added.

None

Accepting his hug, Quinn relaxed for a moment and nodded, smiling at him when he pulled back, yeah, I know
None

I appreciate it, she told him honestly.

None

We all do, Rachel said softly, kissing Abby's forehead.

None

You're all welcome, he said, unable to hide the blush growing on his cheeks, I honestly don't know if it was my training that took over more, or parenting instincts that had just resurfaced, but whatever it was, I'm glad that Quinn and I are home safe and that Abby ended up where she belongs, he moved towards Puck, Rachel and Abby and rested his hand gently on Abby's back, I wasn't going to let anything happen to any of us.

None

...

None

Everyone knew Ethan was right
None

What had happened was in the past and they were home safe, so they settled to be thankful things worked out and pushed any worries they had aside
None

After a few moments of watching the family moment between grandpa and his granddaughter, the larger group began to say their goodbyes for the day and head home, knowing they'd see each other during the rest of the week.

None

When Alan pulled his and David's SUV up to Puck, Rachel and Abby's house, the teens were glad to be home
None

It had been a big trip and as much as they enjoyed the time away, they also enjoyed being at home, too
None

Rachel took Abby out of her car seat and headed inside immediately, while her dads and Puck started unpacking their bags and was greeted by a very happy Kona as soon as she pushed the door open
None

Abby was even smiling and reaching out for Kona, so Rachel moved into the living room and put her down on the floor, you missed Kona, didn't you? Rachel asked, watching Abby walk towards Kona, who was sitting nearby, wagging her tail.

None

Digging out her camera from her purse still over her shoulder, Rachel snapped a few photos of Abby hugging Kona, her little hands gripping onto Kona's soft black and brown fur and the dog's tail continued to wag happily, sorry we had to leave you at home, Kona, Rachel admitted, moving to kneel in front of her.

None

Kona! Abby grinned, now leaning against Kona a little.

None

Rachel grinned brightly, yes, Abby, that's right, her name is Kona, she replied, patting Abby's back and petting Kona.

None

Puck walked into the house with their suitcases and smiled seeing Abby and Rachel kneeling down with Kona

Pulling out his own camera from his pocket, that was still there from that morning, he snapped a few pictures of them before Kona realized he was there

I'm guessing she missed us, he commented as she turned her head to him and wagged her tail, getting up and moving away from them to go greet Puck.

None

I think so, Rachel agreed, watching him kneel down and scratch behind her ears a few times
None

And Abby even said her name, she added with a smile.

Thanks, dad, daddy, I could have helped, Rachel admitted, standing up and keeping an eye on Abby wandering around the living room with Kona right by her.

Noah brought the most of it in with your bags, so it was just the car seat and the playpen and some other things, David shrugged.

And even if you left something in the car, we can always bring it back over, Alan added.

That is true, she agreed, are you guys going to stay for dinner?

None

Nah, I think we're gonna go home and relax, too, David commented, been a fun, but long trip for all of us.

Rachel nodded, I'm glad you guys came with us.

None

David and Alan stayed for a short time to make sure that Rachel and Puck were settled and things were okay at the house before they left, leaving the teens to relax and do what they wanted
None

When her dads left, Rachel put Abby in her playpen and the couple took their things upstairs and changed into comfortable clothes, looking forward to just kicking back for the night.

None

After finding something to eat and getting Abby fed and things taken care of, they put in a movie they'd seen before, but enjoyed, and settled in to watch it
None

Both were glad for the change of pace and knew the rest of the week would be hectic, so they soaked in all the time together that they could get and once they had gotten Abby into bed for the night, they finally got a chance to be alone
None

Having stayed in a hotel room with her dads, it was not possible for the couple to be intimate and both missed each other, so they found themselves turning in early to really have some time to be

The next day, Monday and the first official day of Spring Break, the teens spent most of it unpacking and doing laundry from their trip
None

Puck also went to check-in with his recruiter, like he'd been doing once a week for the past few months, while Rachel, Quinn, Deborah, Susan, Jessica and Carole talked about last minute details for the next day; the day Burt and Carole were getting married.

recruiter has no Synonyms in the API
['check', 'with', 'recruiter']

Burt and Carole liked how Ethan and Deborah setup their wedding the year prior, so they decided to do something similar; getting married at the court house with a few of their adult friends and sons as witnesses and then joining their friends and family someplace for a small reception

None

Because it was Spring and the weather was untrustworthy to be outside, they rented the banquet room at Breadsticks, since they wouldn't have a whole bunch of guests and Breadsticks would supply the food and drinks.

None

When Tuesday morning arrived, everyone seemed to be going in different directions, but it was really only two places
None

Rachel, along with Burt, Carole, Finn, Kurt, Rachel's dads and Puck's parents would be going to the court house for the ceremony, while Puck, Abby and Arin headed to Breadsticks to help Quinn and the others get ready for the reception
None

Rachel was only going to the courthouse with them because the couple had asked Rachel to be their photographer, giving her an opportunity to get experience working during a wedding.

After a simple yet meaningful ceremony, including exchanging rings in front of everyone, Burt and Carole were officially married and Rachel tried to capture as many moments as she could
None

When they were done with the ceremony, they took some time to get some nice photos taken of the new Hudson-Hummel family with and without their additional guests, before everyone piled into cars and headed to Breadsticks for their reception.

ceremony has no Synonyms in the API
None

Since Rachel was there as a family friend, she balanced her time between wandering around and snapping photos of guests and the newly married couple, while also enjoying seeing Puck carrying around their eleven month old daughter in her little lavender dress and matching shoes
None

Rachel made sure she got pictures of them, and Jessica was kind of working as Rachel's assistant, helping her with taking pictures of the reception, so Rachel didn't have to 'work' the whole time
None

It also gave Rachel an opportunity to be in some of the pictures with Abby, Puck, their friends and family and each other, so neither one was behind the camera all day.

After the reception came to an end and guests began to leave, Burt and Carole also left, heading south to Columbus for a few days for a small honeymoon, leaving Finn, Kurt and Quinn alone at home
None

The teens were glad their parents were getting some time away and promised they'd be good and Ben, Susan, Ethan, Deborah, David and Alan all assured them they'd keep an eye on the teens to make sure they didn't have any 'wild parties' while they were gone.

None

Abby had lasted several hours past her usual nap time, curious about everything going on, but finally fell asleep around three, in her dad's arms
None

Puck found a quiet corner to sit down, and gently settled her into her car seat so she could sleep and he could kick back for a while.

None

Once the newlyweds left, their close friends and family who were still there began to help clean up and Rachel moved towards her boyfriend, who also had her camera bag, and took a seat next to him, thank you, Noah, Rachel said softly.

None

For what? He wondered, slipping an arm around her shoulders.

None

For watching Abby all day, she explained, motioning to her camera, and for pointing out how much I enjoyed photography.

None

You're welcome, babe, he smiled, kissing her gently, and don't worry about me with Abby all day

She's our daughter and I love hanging out with her, he explained, before continuing to respond to her other comment, sometimes people just need an outsiders opinion
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

You were amazing today, and always are with this
this has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm really proud of you
None

Are you happy? He asked honestly
None

He could tell that day she was, but he still wanted to ask to be sure.

None

Rachel smiled, yes I am
None

It was so fun today
None

I'm happy for Burt and Carole, but I also really enjoyed being able to be a photographer and help capture important moments for someone, she admitted, and Burt and Carole are letting me use the pictures in a portfolio of my work to show people.

None

That's awesome, baby, Puck replied, and I'm sure before you graduate high school you're going to have a ton of different events to add to it, too.

None

I hope so, she said, leaning her head on his shoulder to relax for a moment.

None

Puck smiled at her rubbed her back a little, I gotta admit, I thought about our wedding today, he said softly.

None

Really? You did? She asked surprised, sitting up a little to look at him.

None

Yeah, he nodded, wondering who's gonna be our photographer, because I don't really think you can be in two places at once.

None

Rachel blushed at his comment, I never thought of that
None

I suppose we'll have to hire someone
None

I mean, if we have one because, you know, you haven't proposed yet, she said with a wink.

wink has no Synonyms in the API
['say', 'with', 'wink']

Puck smirked, very true, he kissed her gently, I will one day.

None

And you already know my answer, she smiled.

None

Yeah, I do, he returned her smile and held her close to him, but I'm gonna make sure I surprise you, so even if I know your answer, you won't know when it's coming.

None

The blush on Rachel's cheeks continued and she nodded, okay..
None

You know I'm not a huge fan of surprises, but for that, I'm willing to wait
None

I know you'll want to plan something special and I definitely want to be surprised.

None

Good, I'm glad you agreed, he smiled brightly, because I'm gonna figure out some way to make it epic.

None

With the wedding behind them, Rachel, Puck and their families and friends had agreed to help move David and Alan into their new house
None

For the past few weeks, the two men had been slowly going through belongings, sorting out what to move into their new place, what Rachel should have in her's and Puck's and what to get rid of
None

They'd moved some boxes and clothes over to their new place, but knew they couldn't move all their furniture alone, so Ethan, David and Alan took the kids' whole Spring Break off for the big move
None

Puck and Rachel asked the club if anyone would be willing to help and they knew that Puck's relatives, Finn, Kurt and Quinn would, and Matt, Mike, Tina, Mercedes, Ryan and TJ offered to join them, so Wednesday morning around nine, everyone met at the Berry's to get to work.

None

Rachel was still a mix of emotions about their move
None

The house held a lot of wonderful memories for her and her family, so she hated to let go, but she was also excited that her dads would be living within walking distance to where she, Puck and Abby now lived
None

She'd gone through the house a few months prior, taking pictures of each room as she remembered it before they began packing, so she could have a 'keepsake' to jog her memories in the future.

None

David and Alan had only boxed up their den, which was their office, and their bedroom, so while the guys started moving out couches, other furniture and already packed boxes, the girls worked on packing everything they could into cardboard boxes and plastic storage containers
None

Rachel went through the living room with a box and filled it with her things like trophies and plaques; what she wanted to keep and took it up to her room
box has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'box']

They had been filling her room with all of the boxes that were hers, knowing she'd want to move most to her and Puck's place.

all has no Synonyms in the API
None

They were only renting a small U-Haul, so after a few hours, some of the guys piled into cars and the truck and headed over to the new house to unload things, while others stayed at the house
None

Rachel decided that all the furniture in her room should go over to her dads' place, so she, Tina, Arin and Hannah helped clean out everything from drawers, shelves, her closet and all the other spaces she'd kept things in, filling several boxes and bags full of items to go through at her and Puck's home.

None

...

None

With all the extra hands to help out, by the end of Wednesday, most everything had been moved and that evening, everyone who had helped gathered at David and Alan's new place for pizza as a thank you, just like they had done for lunch
None

They were far from done; they still had several storage rooms to clean out along with Rachel's room and other places in the house, but they were getting there.

None

Thursday and Friday were spent doing much of the same thing, but not all of the Glee members who'd helped the first day returned, having other plans and Deborah stayed home with Abby
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

She couldn't do a lot of lifting and even though Abby wasn't in the way, because she'd been in her play pen, someone had to keep an eye on her most of the day, so Deborah offered to stay home and watch her, letting Rachel and Puck focus on their tasks.

None

By the end of Friday, if it wasn't cleaning supplies, or attached to the house in some way, it had been packed up and moved
None

David and Alan were surprised, but happy that they'd gotten things done in just a short time and knew their new house had a lot of work before it'd be organized, but they had time now and really appreciated everyone who helped them.

None

With Friday being the last 'day' of Spring Break, the kids only had the weekend left before they'd be back to school
None

Even though they'd been busy during most of their break, Puck and Ethan still had one more project they wanted to take care of: the nursery for the soon-to-be new addition to the Puckerman family
None

Back in March, while the guys were still working on the garage, they'd taken a night off and painted the nursery the shade of pink that Deborah wanted, so now all that was left was to put together the furniture and organize everything.

None

...

None

Wanting it to be a surprise, Deborah agreed to not 'snoop' at what her son, daughter and husband were doing, and spent the days over at Puck and Rachel's
None

Rachel still hadn't gone through the photos from Burt and Carole's wedding and with Deborah's help, they picked out the best photos of the couple, their family and close friends to print out
None

Once Rachel did some minor editing to remove some red eyes and crop out additional people in some of them, she printed out a few copies and compiled a disk of all of the photos, along with a back-up for her
None

Soon, she, Deborah and Abby were walking down to the Hudson-Hummel home to drop them off Sunday afternoon.

None

Rachel, Deborah and Abby hung out for about an hour with them, looking at the photos, talking about their trip and catching up in general, because they'd been gone for the past week and had only gotten back the day before
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

As they left, Rachel couldn't believe that Carole and Burt insisted she take two-hundred dollars from them for all her work.

None

I can't believe that, Rachel admitted, when they were about halfway home
None

I really shouldn't have taken the money from them.

None

Deborah smiled, that's understandable and it's wonderful that you would have done all that for free, but it's a lot of work
None

I mean between the hours you spent taking them, gathering them, sorting them out, putting them onto one disk, picking the best ones, editing the ones you printed out and all the other things you did
None

It's definitely worth something, she explained
None

You took some amazing photos at the wedding, and Jessica helped, I know, but look at how much it cost us for just two hours and some family photos together last year
None

Then think about a wedding and all the additional things.

None

You're right
None

I guess I'm just used to doing most of that for myself, so I didn't really think it was a big deal, but I'm gonna have to figure out what to charge for that, she blushed, thank you, though
None

I really enjoyed doing all this, but I didn't expect payment because they're like family, Rachel admitted.

None

Yeah, but they trust you and can see your work is worth it
None

I'm very proud of you, Deborah smiled, slipping her arm around her shoulders and giving her a partial hug.

None

Thanks mom, the teen smiled brightly, that really means a lot
None

I'm far from putting myself out there to the public, but I'm getting close
None

I'm going to take the photography class next year at McKinley
None

It teaches us the program I already use, but also other aspects, so I thought it might be a good class to take to get some more experience before OSU.

None

That's a great idea, Rachel
None

If you want to take it and it fits into your schedule, I say go for it, Deborah agreed, and I have a job for you, too.

None

You do? What is it? Rachel wondered, pausing on the sidewalk outside of her house.

None

We've been taking photos all during my pregnancy, so I have a lot, but with it being so close to the birth, I was hoping we could do some geared towards that and also some family photos of Noah, Ethan, Arin and I
None

Of course, after her birth I'd like some newborn ones of her, some of the family and definitely ones before Noah leaves, and well, you get the idea, Deborah grinned.

None

Rachel giggled lightly, but understood; she could tell she was excited and also wanted to help her get experience, so it worked out for both of them, I can definitely do all of those
None

I'd love to, actually
None

I'd also like to get some family ones of all of us, too, so that will work out perfectly, she bit her lip, I can't believe Noah's graduating and leaving in a little over two months.

None

Deborah nodded, I know
None

It seems like just yesterday he was talking about it
None

Now it's almost time for him to leave
None

My little boy is graduating high school and joining the Navy, that's tough to believe, she admitted, wiping her eyes as tears built up.

None

Oh, mom, I'm sorry
None

I didn't mean to make you cry, Rachel admitted reaching to hug Deborah with one arm, while still holding onto Abby with another.

arm has no Synonyms in the API
['hug', 'deborah', 'with', 'arm']

It's okay, Deborah waved her hand, I'm sure it's gonna happen a lot between now and then.

None

Before Rachel could respond, Puck came out of the house and started walking towards them, hey! You ready to see the nursery?

None

It's done? Rachel asked surprised.

None

Yeah, well, mostly
None

Some things dad said you might want to put where you want, but yeah, we want to show you now, he explained, glancing between them, everything alright?

None

Yes, Deborah nodded with a smile, just hormones and nerves about you leaving.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

That's not for a while, he reminded them, slipping his arms around their shoulders, and it's not for good, he added, let's go show off the nursery.

None

I need to get my camera, so I'll meet you over there, Rachel replied, passing Abby to him.

None

Okay, we'll wait until you join us, Puck smiled, letting Abby settle against his chest and then kissed his girlfriend.

None

...

None

It only took a few minutes before Rachel was joining her family, including her dads, who had gotten there while Deborah, Rachel and Abby had been at the Hudson-Hummel house
None

Now that everyone was there, Ethan guided Deborah into the nursery with her eyes closed and once the couple had stepped inside, the others gathered by the door, you ready? Ethan grinned.

None

Of course I am, Deborah laughed lightly, preparing for tears as Ethan uncovered her eyes and she opened them, gasping as she focused on the room around her.

None

The crib, changing table, dresser and shelves had all been put together and set up around the room, the dark cherry wood contrasting nicely with the light pink wall and neutral tan carpeting
wall has no Synonyms in the API
['contrast', 'with', 'wall']

Bright colored toys and accessories were filling shelves and some of the baby clothes and blankets were hung up in the closet, while others were folded up in drawers or around the room, wanting Deborah to be the one to put them away where she wanted.

None

This is absolutely amazing, she choked out, turning around to hug and kiss her husband, you all did a wonderful job
None

Thank you, she smiled, pulling back and moving over to her son and daughter to hug them.

None

You're welcome, mom
None

It was fun, Puck smiled, kissing her cheek.

None

I'm so excited to meet her! Arin admitted, hugging Deborah and resting her hand on her stomach.

None

We all are, Ethan agreed, slipping his arm around Deborah's shoulders and for a moment the four Puckermans shared a family hug before Rachel, Abby, Alan and David moved inside the room to join them.

None

I also have an addition, Rachel opened her bag and pulled out a picture frame, I had to hide this earlier so you didn't see it, she admitted, handing it over.

None

Oh wow, Deborah grinned, I haven't even looked at our photos from the trip yet, she admitted, seeing the photo of the seven of them on the stage at Nationals after they'd won, this will be great.

None

Really? Awesome! I wasn't sure if I should use the one of just you guys or if you'd be okay with that one
one has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'one']

Noah suggested I use that one, Rachel motioned to the one in the frame, with all of us
all has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's the most recent family photo we have of all of us together.

None

And we already have a spot for it, Puck motioned to an empty nail on the wall.

None

Deborah moved over and carefully adjusted the frame and hung it up on the nail, stepping back and smiling, perfect.

None

...

None

With the nursery complete, except for some things Deborah needed to find a spot for, the close-knit Puckerman and Berry family looked forward to meeting the new addition
None

In the last year and a half, the two families, because of Puck and Rachel's relationship had grown close and the term 'in-laws' never was used, unless making an official introduction to explain their relationship to someone new.

None

Having dinner together, the family kicked back in the living room afterward, David, Alan, we have a question for you guys, Deborah admitted.

None

For us? David asked curiously.

None

Yeah, Ethan nodded, we've been talking, he motioned between him and Deborah, and we realized that you guys don't have a title.

None

What kind of title are we talking about? Alan wondered curiously.

None

We know you're Rachel's dads, but ever since we've known you, you've been more than just family friends
None

We were wondering what you'd think about being uncles to Arin and our new baby? Deborah asked, you've helped us out a lot and given that we're all close, we'd like you to have a more family title, because you're part of our family.

None

David and Alan exchanged glances and smiled, we really appreciate that and we'd be happy to be their uncles, David replied.

None

Awesome, Ethan smiled, we hoped you'd be okay to that, but we wanted to ask to be sure
None

We know it's nothing official, but it means something to us.

None

Alan nodded in agreement, it does and we're happy to be a part your family.

None

...

None

With no more competitions for the rest of the year, New Directions was all glad to have ended their 'season' on a high note and when they returned to school from break, the school actually welcomed them back as winners; recognizing what they'd done and raised them a little further up the food chain of the school, so they weren't completely 'losers' anymore.

None

During the first week back, the Glee Club received their money from the competition and also found out the pictures taken of them would be used in an end-of-the-year newsletter from the the Show Choir Board to announce them as winners, and their photos would also be posted online for the time being in honor of their win
None

The school district was also proud to say they had a winning team among them and assured Will and the club that they'd continue to keep the club around and even offered more funding and support, in hopes that the club would continue to win in the future.

None

Because of their win, the district also invited a writer from the Allen County Herald to visit that week
None

The club performed Rachel and Quinn's duet from Nationals, to show what they could do and afterward, the teens and their directors posed for some photos with their trophy
None

The writer also did a brief interview with the directors, Puck, Rachel, Kurt, Ryan and Quinn; the only ones who didn't mind being quoted in the paper
None

By Saturday, their congratulatory article made it into the the paper and the entire club loved that they were finally getting recognition for what they were doing
None

Rachel made a trip to the store to pick up several copies of the paper to keep and some to send to relatives, because she and Puck had both been quoted, and because they were the president and the vice president they also got a picture of just themselves in the paper, so it was a big deal for them.

None

Though the celebrations had come to an end and almost everything was back to normal by the beginning of the new week, the teens did notice, though, that the school didn't see them as the 'losers' anymore
None

They'd moved up a little higher on the 'food' chain; something they'd always wanted, and it was all because they'd finally brought a big win to McKinley.

None

Once things got back to normal, the Glee Club began preparations for their end of the year concerts
None

Like the year before, the first few days of June, the club would travel to the middle schools in the area that had students who would be attending McKinley in the next school year, to try to bring in new members in and they hoped their win would also help the member count
None

They were also going to do a concert during the school day at McKinley, as well as one that night for their friends, family, and the public, and decided that would be the time they did the big show, because they wouldn't have a lot of time at each middle school to do a long list of songs.

None

The club also had their performance for graduation to work on
None

Figgins had asked them to sing at the ceremony, so everyone began trying to come up with good songs for that
song has no Synonyms in the API
None

They didn't know how long they'd have, so they decided on a handful of songs they could learn
None

Most of them weren't too upbeat, so they could stick to simple choreography, yet they still could show off their vocal talent and keep with a traditional commencement ceremony.

ceremony has no Synonyms in the API
None

April continued uneventful and the teens continued their work on their music
None

They came up with a good set list for the middle schools, McKinley and the evening concert, they'd picked the songs for graduation, learned the familiar vocals and harmonies quickly and came up with a simple choreography to go along with them
list has no Synonyms in the API
choreography has no Synonyms in the API
['come', 'with', 'choreography']

They were still meeting Mondays and Thursdays after school, but had added in some lunch practices, because some members had other after school activities going on and they didn't want to miss Glee practice.

None

Since school was getting closer to the end of the year, some teachers were starting to cut back on homework, while others piled it on and everyone had to work to keep their grades up
None

The Seniors were close to the end and knew they had to be extra careful that their grades didn't drop; the last thing they wanted to do was slack off the last few months and then find out they'd failed a class and wouldn't be able to graduate on time.

None

...

None

Deborah's mid-May due date was approaching quickly
None

Because both Arin and Puck had been early, everyone expected their sister to be, also, so they were making plans, arrangements and having bags packed for when the time did come.

None

Puck, Rachel and their families were spending extra time at David and Alan's new place, helping them get things organized
None

Most everything had just been moved into the room they wanted it in, but not much had been unpacked, except things what they used daily.

None

They had taken a weekend to do the family pictures Deborah had wanted before the baby was born; some ones geared towards her pregnancy, featuring her, Ethan, Puck and Arin, mostly
None

Jessica, David and Alan also came over to help out, and Jessica took the pictures of the close Berry and Puckerman family
None

Rachel was gland for the help and once she had a chance to look at all the photos from that day, she was happy to see how they turned out and looked forward to adding those types of photos to the list of ones she did.

None

In addition to everything else going on, Rachel, Puck and their family and friends were also planning Abby's first birthday party
None

They decided that even though her official birthday fell on a Sunday, they'd do her party the day before, the last day of April, giving everyone a chance to recover the next day, before returning to work and school.

None

...

None

When the last day of April finally arrived, Puck wasn't surprised when he woke up and found Rachel wasn't in bed
None

It was just before eight in the morning and he could faintly hear her voice coming through the baby monitor
None

Smiling, he slowly crawled out of bed and after tossing on a shirt and a pair of sweats, he padded into the nursery and leaned against the door frame, watching Rachel in the rocker, holding Abby, who was just waking up and content to snuggle against her.

None

Hard to believe she's a year old, Puck commented softly.

None

Rachel glanced up when she heard his voice, yeah, she agreed, she's growing too fast.

None

Moving towards her, he nodded, she is, he murmured, greeting each of them with a kiss on the forehead, it sucks, but I can't wait until she starts learning and doing more.

kiss has no Synonyms in the API
['greet', 'each', 'with', 'kiss']

Yeah, but not for a while, right? I mean, she's walking and talking a little and is picking up more and more
None

She's already a year old and this year has gone by so fast, she murmured.

None

She's not going to be starting school tomorrow, babe, Puck replied gently, resting his hand on her shoulder, she has tons to learn and she'll grow a little each day
None

It may seem like she's growing fast, but she won't be
None

Just a day at a time
None

She'll be picking up more words and colors, she'll be steadier on her feet, and slowly will be catching on to other things
None

I definitely don't want her growing very fast, he admitted kneeling down and brushing his hand over her Abby's cheek, cause I'm gonna miss a lot.

None

No you're not, Rachel shook her head, I'm going to be taking pictures all the time and I'll get videos when I can
None

When you're settled wherever you're going to be working after boot camp, we can video chat and talk online
None

You're not going to miss much, she promised.

None

Puck smiled at her, thanks, and I'm going to be back as often as I can
None

You know, I hate to say this, but sometimes I think that being apart a little might actually be a good thing for us, he said softly.

None

Rachel nodded, I was thinking that, too, she admitted honestly, resting her hand on his cheek
None

It's going to hurt to have you gone, but it will give us an opportunity to be a little independent
None

I know many couples, if they're together all the time, like we have been, can sometime cause strain on their relationship and I don't want that to happen to us.

None

Same here and the time we do have together, will be even more special, he leaned in and pressed a kiss to her lips, I love you both, so much, he replied.

None

Love
None

Dada, Abby said, in a soft voice, reaching out to him.

None

Even so young, there was no mistaking the words she said and Puck grinned brightly, taking her into his arms, standing up and holding her close, that's awesome, baby girl
None

You said a new word and it's a perfect one
None

I definitely love you, he murmured, kissing her cheek and snuggling her, one of his hands resting gently on her back.

None

Rachel returned Puck's smile and felt just as proud as she knew he was for the new word she said
None

Standing up she wrapped her arms around his waist and rested her head on his chest, looking at Abby, I love you, too, sweetheart.

None

Puck shifted his arm so he could wrap it around Rachel, while still holding Abby against him, hopefully we can help her understand exactly what it means, he said softly.

None

Yeah, but it's a start, Rachel replied looking at him.

None

Abby reached a hand out and rested it on Rachel's cheek, love mama, she said simply.

None

Or maybe she gets it, he smirked, seeing Rachel's wide eyes.

None

Rachel gently took Abby's hand in hers and kissed it, then tickled her tummy a little before kissing her cheek, I think she does, she admitted happily, and I'm so proud of you, little one.

None

Me too, Puck agreed, kissing Rachel's cheek and relaxing, ready for today?

None

Taking a deep breath, Rachel nodded, ready as I'll ever be.

None

...

None

For the next few hours, the couple worked on finishing up preparations for the party, though most had been done the night before
None

The four dads had even helped clean up the backyard so people could be outside, since the weather was warm and they hoped it'd stay that way for the party.

None

Their parents and Arin came over about eleven to help finish the set up, and a little later Ben, his family, including Jessica, along with Quinn, Finn and Kurt arrived
None

Burt and Carole were going to pick up the cake and would be there a bit later and the rest of their family and friends wouldn't be over until closer to one.

None

Just before noon, Rachel put Abby down for a nap, knowing she wouldn't be able to make it all day without one and figured it'd be better she sleep until a little after everyone got there and when she got up, they'd be ready to open presents and cut the cake.

None

How does it feel to be the parents of a year old baby? David asked as the small group sat around the living room.

None

She's not one until tomorrow, officially, Rachel grinned.

None

Puck smirked, close enough
None

It doesn't feel any different than it did yesterday

Day by day it's okay; ask me when she's starts school
None

Then I'll be freaking out about how much she's grown.

None

Rachel blushed, yeah, I guess you're right
None

I don't even want to think about her starting school; that's too far off from now
None

Can't we just enjoy now?

None

Very good idea, Deborah nodded, enjoy the time you have now, because as soon as she gets older, you'll be wondering where time went.

None

That is very true, Alan nodded in agreement.

None

Before anyone else could respond, Carole and Burt arrived with the cake and Rachel jumped up to go greet them, hey! Thanks for bringing over the cake, she admitted.

cake has no Synonyms in the API
['arrive', 'with', 'cake']

You're welcome
None

We figured you had enough going on, so it would be one less thing to worry about, Carole replied.

None

Taking the smaller box from Burt, Rachel and Carole moved into the kitchen to set the cakes on the counter and Carole showed them to her
None

They hadn't gone with a specific theme, but Abby loved the large stuffed Tigger she'd gotten at the holidays, so they decided to get the cake decorated with the Disney character, while adding in some purples and pinks to keep it 'girlie'
theme has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'theme']

The second and smaller cake was just for Abby
None

It was common at first birthday parties for the child to play with their cake, so the smaller one was covered in only white icing, so it didn't have any of the colorful food coloring that the other cake had; perfect for her to reach into without getting dye all over her clothes.

cake has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'cake']

With her camera, Rachel snapped several photos of each cake at different angles so she had less to do later and then she and Carole returned to the others, settling in to continue talking until the rest of their guests arrived.

None

...

None

As friends and family of Puck and Rachel began to arrive, the house was filling up, so the adults moved outside, leaving the kids in the house
None

Most of Puck and Rachel's extend families had joined them, including cousins, aunts, uncles and grandmas, and most of their Glee friends were there, Will and Emma also attended and even Rachel's two friends from Vocal Adrenaline and Shelby came up for the party.

None

By two, everyone was there and they were all trying to keep the noise to a minimum, because they knew Abby was napping
None

Hearing her fuss over the baby monitor around three, the teen parents knew she was awake, so they headed upstairs to get her ready for her party, finding Kona laying outside the nursery doorway
None

They quickly realized having everyone there was a big deal for Kona, but she'd rather protect Abby, than inspect everyone, and Rachel couldn't help getting some pictures of her, before they all moved into the nursery to Abby.

None

Puck and Rachel had settled on a cute Hawaiian print dress with pink and purple flowers and once she had it on along with leggings, shoes and socks, they took her downstairs and she quickly became the center of attention
None

Her relatives all tried to get some time with her around having dinner and afterward she was walking around the living and dinning room where Puck, Rachel and their friends had been hanging out
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

It wasn't long before she discovered the brightly covered gifts and was trying to reach for them sitting on the table, so they decided it was a good time to open them
None

Everyone piled into the house and found places to sit or stand and once they got Abby settled on the floor, they began handing her one gift at a time
None

Rachel and Puck were sitting with her to help her, thankful to Jessica and Anna for taking pictures and David for filming, so they could focus on enjoying the time with their daughter.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
daughter has no Synonyms in the API
['enjoy', 'time', 'with', 'daughter']

Abby definitely enjoyed ripping into her gifts and even though they could tell she loved her new gifts, she also enjoyed the brightly colored wrapping paper, ribbons, gift bags and tissue paper they all came in
None

By the time the gifts had all been opened, the living room floor was covered in all the wrap and several of them started to help clean up, while others went to take care of getting the cakes out and set up at the dinning table.

None

Puck brought Abby into the dinning room after a few minutes and they tried to get her to sit on the table next to the big cake so Rachel could get a few pictures, but she kept trying to reach for the toy on the top
None

Getting a few partial shots, Puck sat down at the end of the table to help prop Abby up and with a number '1' birthday candle sitting in the middle of the baby cake, they got it closer to her and she was fascinated by the flame flicking from it.

candle has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'with', 'candle']

The family and friends all gathered around and sang happy birthday to her, and she looked around in curiosity
None

She wasn't quite sure what was going on, but Puck and Rachel got her attention, pointing to the candle and coaxed her to blow it out at the end of the song
None

She took a deep breath and blew out, the candle flickering a little so Puck and Rachel leaned in and helped blow it out for her, earning claps and cheers from everyone there.

None

Now you can dig in, Puck smirked, taking large wax candle out and setting aside before pulling the cake closer to them.

None

Abby turned her head to look at him and Rachel and when they nodded, Abby tentatively reached out and rested her hand on the top of the cake
None

Some of the frosting got stuck on it, so she pulled back, immediately tasting the sticky stuff and liked it, so she went back for more and Puck helped her dig down in to the cake
None

She got both hands into it and soon everyone was laughing and egging her on as she tried to bite into the handful of cake she had in her hands.

None

Both father and daughter played in her cake for a few moments while the other cake was being cut up and once the room thinned out, Puck glanced down at him and Abby
None

She had frosting all over her face, hands and dress, cake crumbs were stuck in the same places and between playing with, eating and holding Abby, Puck had cake and frosting on his pants, hands and a few places on his face.

None

You guys need a bath, Rachel laughed, moving over to them with a damp towel.

towel has no Synonyms in the API
['move', 'with', 'towel']

Puck licked his fingers, nah
None

Just a few towels, he smirked, swiping some frosting from what was left of the cake and acted like he was going to lick it off, just as Rachel was reaching in to wipe Abby's face
None

With a grin, he reached out, pressing the frosting into her skin, uh, babe you have some frosting on your cheek.

None

Noah! Rachel exclaimed, pulling back with a huff, using the towel to wipe it away.

huff has no Synonyms in the API
None

I was gonna lick that off you, but I guess not, he commented, unable to hide the smirk.

None

Rachel felt her cheeks flush, oh.

None

With slightly sticky fingers, Puck reached up and rested his hand on her cheek, you need to relax a bit
None

You've been bouncing around a lot today.

None

Taking a moment to lean into his touch, she nodded, I just want things to go well.

None

They are, he assured her, so why don't you pull up a chair and enjoy some cake with us?

None

Could we at least get Abby cleaned up a little? She asked, pulling the nearest empty chair over to sit next to him.

None

Holding his reply to her question, he leaned in and pressed a kiss to her lips
None

He could feel her melt into it
None

If Abby wasn't in his lap, he'd continue it, but he gently broke apart and rested his forehead against hers, it can wait a few minutes.

None

...

None

Taking his advice, Rachel relaxed for a few moments
None

The brief break was a nice contrast to the busy day she'd had, but it was short lived
None

Abby was starting to fuss, so the young couple, along with Deborah helped get the mess cleaned up
None

Once most of the cake and frosting was wiped off Abby and her clothes, Rachel took her up to change and Puck and Deborah finished cleaning up the mess, finding the stuff on Puck's pants was easy to wipe off, so he didn't have to change.

None

Once the messy, but fun, cake was cleaned up, and Puck actually ate some of the birthday cake for the 'adults', his family from Northern Ohio began to get ready to leave
None

They had the longest drive home and didn't want to get home super late
None

Before they actually did leave, Rachel talked them into staying long enough to get some family pictures and Ethan's entire side of the family, along with Rachel, Abby, Puck, Deborah and Arin, all gathered together and Jessica took a few photos of them.

None

Rachel had wanted to get group shots of the various friends and family members there that day, so just before the rest of the out of town people got ready to leave, Rachel, or Rachel, Puck and Abby posed with them, before saying 'goodbye'
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

David took a few photos of the Glee club members and their directors and spouses, and some of them headed out while others stuck a while and Rachel and Jessica traded taking pictures depending on who was in them to finish them up.

None

Those who stayed, started to help clean up the house and Puck and Rachel were thankful to have all the help
None

Only making a small dent in the clean-up, Puck and Rachel took a break to get Abby bathed and once she was settled in her crib for the night, the couple returned to their friends and family to continue cleaning
None

It wasn't long before the house was clean enough to put the rest off until the next day and after everyone left, Puck and Rachel finally crawled into bed around eleven, exhausted from the day.

None

What a day! Rachel groaned, snuggling up to him, it was amazing to have everyone together, but sometimes I worry the house will explode with so many people in it.

people has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, Puck laughed lightly and nodded, I was thinking that, too
None

We gotta come up with something else
something has no Synonyms in the API
None

I think we need to just keep doing parties for our families at a park, like we're doing mom and dad's at the end of the month, like last year.

None

That's an idea, or we could rent Breadsticks like Burt and Carole did, she suggested.

None

I forgot about that
None

That's actually a really good idea, he admitted, because with all the money we'd save on buying food and drinks, we could put that into the rental and catering fee
money has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's something to think about for the future.

None

It is, Rachel agreed, and I honestly thought we'd be celebrating your sister's arrival, too, she added with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Really? Puck wondered for a moment, I guess it could have happened.

None

Yeah, since mom's due in two weeks, and we've all said that she's going to be early, I thought she might have her, but she didn't
None

She's coming soon, though, Rachel commented, I can't wait to meet her.

None

Same here, Puck smiled, I just hope Arin doesn't get jealous, he added softly.

None

Rachel was about to ask 'why', but she quickly figured out the answer, because dad missed her growing up, but now he's gonna be here for the baby?

None

Yeah, he took a deep breath, dad wasn't around until last year
None

Now he's gonna get to go through all the baby stuff with the new one
one has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'one']

She's done well so far with him coming back, but now mom and dad will have a baby, too
None

Things are gonna change and I just don't want her to think that he likes the baby better than her, or something like that
None

I know he'd never feel that way, but she might not fully understand that, he explained, I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

None

I get it, she nodded in understanding, and mom and dad will be busy, but they're still going to make time for her; they're not going to ignore her or ever make her feel like that, she assured him, resting her hand on his chest, I honestly think she's going to be okay
None

She's learned a lot from being around Abby and now she can help your parents with the baby; she's gonna be a big sister, too
baby has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'parent', 'with', 'baby']

Just like when your mom had her
None

You were no longer your mom's only kid and you helped her out with Arin.

arin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck smiled at her words, getting what she was saying, I hope you're right
None

I can't help worrying, though
None

I'm not gonna be around like I am now and I just don't want her to think she's losing everyone.

None

She won't, Rachel promised, we're all going to be here for her and just because you're not here, doesn't mean she won't be able to call her big brother if she needs him; after you're out of boot camp, at least, she explained.

None

Thanks, he took a deep breath, I've been thinking about taking her out one day, so we can just hang out on our own; some sibling bonding time
None

I haven't talked to her much about me leaving; she seems to know what's going on, but she's never really said much about it
None

She's also almost done with elementary school
school has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'school']

Next year, she'll be in middle school, so I want to see how she's feeling about that and also see how she's feeling about the new baby..
None

Do you think it's a good idea?

None

I think it's a wonderful idea
None

You two should go out and spend time together, she replied honestly, and if I was in your shoes I'd do the exact same thing.

None

Cool
None

I'll figure out when we can
None

Maybe some Saturday or Sunday this month that's free, he replied with a smile, settling further into his pillows to relax.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel snuggled up to him and took a deep breath, that works
None

Time's going too fast and June will be busier for all of us, she murmured.

None

Yeah, I know
None

It feels like we just had Valentine's Day and now it's almost graduation, he agreed, remembering something that was coming up, hey, babe?

None

Looking up at him, she raised a curious eyebrow, yes?

None

Would you like to be my date to prom? He asked with a smile
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

He knew prom was still weeks away and given their relationship it could be assumed they'd go together, but he still wanted to ask her officially.

None

Rachel smiled brightly and leaned up to press a kiss to his lips, I'd love to be.

None

A/N5: It's been suggested I use a time jump to help progress along the story
None

It's a great idea and I plan to do that soon, but right now there are some things I want to incorporate into the fic before Puck's graduation, so I'm going to hold off on the jump until later

I promise you guys will love the stuff I have planned!

It took me 3 days to edit this chapter to post

I might have missed some things, though
None

It'd been so long since I'd worked on it that I'd forgotten some things had to be rewritten, so I had extra work this time around.

I've also mentioned in my author's notes on a few my other WIPs, but to update you all, I had my gallbladder removed on June 12th
None

The surgery went very well - I was home 2 hours after I came out of surgery! I'm recovering well

My incisions are sore, and my abdomen is still tender in spots, but I'm getting better
None

I have my good days and bad days, but I'm definitely on the road to recovery..
None

The draw back is, I think, because of some of the meds I had to hold off on and not take regularly because of the last few weeks, I've been having a hard time focusing on anything for long periods of time

That's why it's taken me so long to update

With Abby's party behind them, Sunday, Puck, Rachel and their daughter were able to spend her official birthday with just her grandparents and Aunt Arin
grandparent has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'birthday', 'with', 'grandparent']

Rachel wanted to get some pictures of her and the family for Abby's '1 Year Old' photos and Jessica stopped in for a short time to help them take some family pictures, so Rachel could be in them.

None

It was a nice opportunity for the close-knit Berry and Puckerman family to spend time together, especially for Ethan and Deborah, because in a few short weeks their next child would be joining the world and both parents, along with their family would have their hands full
None

They'd be caring for a newborn, a one year old, and dealing with everything leading up to Puck's high school graduation and him leaving for boot camp, so it would be quite emotional for everyone.

As the new school week started Monday, their routine quickly returned
None

While the Glee Club spent the week continuing to prepare for their end-of-the-year performances at the middle schools, at McKinley and also for one at graduation, the students and staff were getting ready for the end of the year
None

Some teachers began to pile on the homework, while others continued at the normal pace and no one was looking forward to finals.

None

Aside from being busy with homework and Glee practices, the week was pretty uneventful, so Rachel and Puck spent as much time with Abby as they could
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck, Rachel and their families were all excited for the weekend, because Sunday would be Mother's Day
None

Rachel and Deborah begged their family to refrain from getting them gifts; all they wanted was to spend time with their family and Puck, Ethan, Arin, Alan and David reluctantly agreed to respect their wishes..
family has no Synonyms in the API

mostly.

None

As Friday arrived, the weekend was just around the corner and when Puck, Rachel and Jessica were on their way to school, Puck got concerned when he noticed Rachel was almost in tears
None

Babe, what's wrong?

None

Rachel bit her lip, um..
None

It's getting harder to leave Abby
None

Especially when she says 'mama' or 'dada' and reaches out to us as we're trying to leave your aunt and uncle's, she explained, I'm looking forward to the summer, so I don't have to do that, but I'm also worried about how it will work when I have to go back to school in September.

None

Puck nodded in understanding, well, have you thought about only going to school half time? He wondered, if I understood things correctly, the reason you were able to take a few of the classes you did this year was because you'd already gotten credit for others you needed, so you might not have as many classes to take to still graduate
None

You could work it out with Ms
m has no Synonyms in the API
None

Pillsbury and maybe go to school at lunch time for three classes and then you'd be there for Glee, but you'd still have a few extra hours with Abby in the morning, he explained, knowing of a few Seniors at McKinley who only took a few classes at school.

None

Wow, Rachel contemplated his suggestion, I never thought about that, but you're right
None

I'm pretty sure I don't need to take English, math or science next year, so it is possible
None

I'll go talk to Ms
None

Pillsbury today and see what she can tell me, she admitted, but then glanced in the backseat at Jessica, but what about carpooling?

None

Don't worry about me, Jessica assured her, I totally love and appreciate the rides to school, so I don't have to go as early as my dad does, but mom and dad promised that if I kept my grades up and finished this year with at least a 'B' in all my classes, they'd get me a car this summer
b has no Synonyms in the API
['finish', 'with', 'b']

I'm getting an 'A' or 'B' in all my classes, so I'm hoping that by the time we start our Senior year, I'll have my own wheels
None

I think Noah is right
None

If you took only the classes you need and tried to get them so you could go to school in only the afternoon, you'd have more time with Abby.

abby has no Synonyms in the API

Rachel smiled at nodded at the two Puckermans and took a deep breath, I will look into it
None

I think it sounds like a great idea!

None

...

None

Puck's suggestion and Jessica's encouragement gave Rachel a lot to think about
None

They were completely right
None

There was no point in her taking more classes if she didn't need them to graduate; especially if it meant giving her more time with Abby
abby has no Synonyms in the API

When they arrived at McKinley, Rachel excused herself from her boyfriend and Jessica and headed for Emma's office
None

As she reached it, she found Will inside with Emma, oh, sorry
emma has no Synonyms in the API
None

I didn't mean to interrupt, Rachel admitted, pausing in the doorway.

None

No, don't worry
None

You're not interrupting, Rachel, Emma said standing up, how can I help you? Is everything alright?

None

Yes, it is, Rachel assured her, but I have some questions about my schedule next year and wanted to see if it was even possible
None

I could make an appointment for later in the day, if you'd rather, but I thought I'd stop in now to see about it.

None

I'll leave you two to talk
None

See you later, Will waved at them and left the office, giving them some privacy.

None

Emma motioned to an empty seat by her desk, have a seat, Rachel
None

We can talk now
None

What would you like to know?

None

Rachel explained the conversation she'd had in the car on the way to school with Puck and Jessica, if it's possible, I'd like to have a shorter school day
None

Maybe only coming to school at lunch time for three classes and still be here for Glee.

None

I completely understand and there are several Seniors who only go half a day
None

They're in a similar situation as you with their classes
class has no Synonyms in the API
None

There are a few who only go in the morning and leave at lunchtime, and also a few who take afternoon classes, Emma pulled up Rachel's information and after skimming over it, she nodded, from what is required to graduate, by the end of the year, you'll have met your English, math, science and history requirements
None

You still need a few more electives, Emma confirmed
None

Have you already turned in the class registration for next year?

None

Yes, last week, Rachel nodded
None

I really am that close to graduating?

None

It looks like it and if you take a few electives, computer classes and others, you'll be ready to graduate, Emma pulled up the following year schedule system and nodded, I see what you registered for
None

You're not taking choir? She asked surprised.

None

Since I've decided to put my focus on my photography business and my family, I didn't see a need to take up a class with choir when I have Glee that I enjoy more
choir has no Synonyms in the API
['take', 'class', 'with', 'choir']

I also thought it would free me up to take a few classes that could help me with my photography and give me a chance to see if it's really what I want to do, before I go to OSU and major in it, Rachel explained.

photography has no Synonyms in the API
['help', '-PRON-', 'with', 'photography']

Emma nodded, that's quite understandable

You've met your history requirements, and Psychology is in that category, so you know you don't have to take it, right?

None

I know, but my daddy's a psychologist, so I thought it would be neat to take a class and learn a little more about what he deals with, Rachel admitted.

what has no Synonyms in the API

Oh yes, Emma blushed, I forgot he was a psychologist.

Emma did a few things on her computer and then turned the screen so Rachel could see it, I've dropped the English, Math and Science classes and left you with the other three
three has no Synonyms in the API

The teachers haven't set their class times yet, but once we get those, I'll be able to schedule you for them
None

There will be a few things I need from you and your dads, she printed off the tentative schedule and an unofficial transcript, then went to get a few sheets out of her file cabinet
None

Grabbing the printed paper, she returned to her desk, you need to apply for three free periods
None

There's a box asking for 'why' and you just explain because you're a mom and want more time with your daughter or something like that
daughter has no Synonyms in the API
['want', 'time', 'with', 'daughter']

Get your dads to agree and sign it, along with you and then myself and Principal Figgins will go through the application
None

You need to have a good grade point average, which you do, and a good reason and I don't see any reason why he'd say 'no', but we have to do it officially
None

Once it's approved and we know when those classes will be offered, we can schedule you.

None

Really? It's that easy? Rachel gasped, taking the papers, when Noah mentioned it, I hadn't even thought about something like this.

None

Yes
None

You've met the requirements, so you don't have to take more of them, just to fill your day, in a sense wasting your time
None

When I was a Senior in high school, I did that
None

Actually I only had one free period at the end of the day, so I went home after fifth period, but still, it was one less class I didn't need to take, she explained.

None

Rachel looked over the sheets and slid them into her bag, thank you
None

I'll talk to my dads this weekend and try to get these back next week.

None

...

None

With only a short time before classes began, Rachel made her way towards her locker and found her boyfriend, Jessica and several of their friends standing around
None

Hey, babe
None

You talk to Ms
None

Pillsbury? Puck asked.

None

I did, she nodded, and I have some paperwork to look at and fill out with my dads, but she's pretty confident I'll be able to have a short school day next year, she smiled, and it will definitely give Abby and I some time together in the morning.

['fill', 'with', 'dad']

Wait, what were you doing? Tina asked.

None

Talking to Ms
None

Pillsbury about next year
None

I've met the graduation requirements for several of my classes, so instead of taking classes I don't need, I'm only going to have three a day
None

Two of them will be helpful with my business, Rachel explained opening her locker and digging for the books she needed for her first class.

None

Whoa, you can do that? Mercedes wondered, surprised.

None

Yes
None

It's not an option for everyone, but for some it is, Rachel said, I didn't even know it was possible until Noah brought it up on the way to school.

None

There's a guy in my sixth period that only has afternoon classes
None

That's how I knew about it, Puck shrugged.

None

Rachel closed her locker and slipped her arm around her boyfriend's waist, well, I'm glad you did
None

It will be nice if everything works out, because I won't have to be away from Abby as long.

None

Even though I know you're parents, sometimes it's still really hard to believe that you are, Tina admitted, blushing lightly.

None

Puck glanced at Rachel and smiled, sometimes it's surprising for us, too
None

We have those moments when it hits us that we're parents.

None

We do, Rachel agreed and smiled brightly, but I wouldn't change a thing
None

I love our daughter; she's perfect.

None

...

None

Over the next few classes, since Puck and Rachel had them together, Puck noticed Rachel seemed to drift off several times
None

It was odd, because he was used to her being very focused on taking as many notes as she could during their teacher's lecture
None

Now, she hardly wrote in her notebook and he found himself writing more than usual, as a way to make up for what she wasn't doing
None

When the two finally made it to lunch and got their food, they sat down at the table where the club usually ate and some of their friends were already there
None

Alright, where have you been all morning? Puck asked curiously.

None

In class with you, Rachel replied, turning to look at him, what do you mean?

None

Yeah, physically maybe, he agreed, but ever since first period all of a sudden your face goes blank and it's like you're day dreaming
None

What are you thinking about?

None

Oh, she blushed, reaching for her bottle of water, with all the talk this morning about my schedule for next year, it got me thinking about how things will work when you're not here
talk has no Synonyms in the API
None

Realizing that so many things I'm used to now, will be gone and it won't be the same, no matter how much we try, she explained softly.

None

Puck nodded, slipping his arm around her shoulders and pulling her close to him, I know, babe
None

I think about it, too
None

A lot of things will be different, but we're going to be okay
None

Things will be tough, but I know we can handle it; we're strong.

None

I hope I am
None

I've never had to deal with someone I love leaving for such a long time
someone has no Synonyms in the API
['deal', 'with', 'someone']

I know there's a first time for everything and it will give us an opportunity to grow a lot more on our own, too, but it's still rough to think about, she took a deep breath, and it wasn't all about us as a couple
None

It was also about us as a club, she motioned around the table, you, Finn, Quinn, Matt, Mike and Ryan won't be here
None

The club isn't going to be the same.

None

But we're still going to be around, Quinn assured her, I know it won't be the same as being here every day, but we're all going to stop in and we can still help the club; just not as members, anymore.

None

That will be wonderful, Rachel smiled at the blond, and I know it's part of growing up, but it's still a weird feeling.

None

It is, Kurt nodded, looking around at their friends, and you're not the only one who has a boyfriend graduating.

None

Wait, what? Rachel gasped, at the same time as some of the others did.

None

Kurt glanced at Ryan, and then returned his gaze to everyone else, as you know, since Ryan joined the club, he's been involved a lot with things we do
thing has no Synonyms in the API
['involve', 'lot', 'with', 'thing']

In that time we started to get to know each other, but it wasn't until Christmas break that we really started hanging out
None

Since then, we've gone out a lot more, but we never really labeled our relationship
None

That was until we went up to Detroit for Nationals
None

We decided to make it official, so we've been boyfriends since then, Kurt explained with a smile.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

We apologize for not telling anyone sooner, but we didn't want to change everything all at once
None

We chose to keep it between us for a short time, but we decided it was time to tell you all, Ryan added.

None

The teens around the table congratulated Kurt and Ryan on their relationship, I had a feeling you guys were dating; you're always going out with him, Quinn admitted.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Me too, Rachel agreed, I've seen Ryan's car pass by our house several times a week and had a feeling your relationship had gotten more serious
None

I'm happy for you both.

None

Thank you, Kurt smiled, and I definitely get what you're feeling about things changing next year; it's gonna be weird not having Ryan in Glee.

None

Rachel nodded and took her boyfriend's hand in hers, squeezing it gently as she looked around at the table at their friends; some of them also being couples, it will be very odd not having everyone there next year, so I suggest that we all make the most out of the next few weeks that we have together, as friends, classmates and significant others.

None

Puck smiled at her and kissed her cheek, I think that's a great idea, babe.

None

...

None

Since lunch was about an hour and a half long, no one was in too much of a hurry to finish eating, but as they finished, the teens continued to sit at the table, some doing homework so they had less over the weekend and others read a book, or talked to their friends
None

A little after eleven-forty-five, Ben made his way over to the table and Puck was the first to notice his concerned look, what's wrong, Uncle Ben? Puck asked quickly.

None

Puck's question startled Rachel and she looked at Ben and Puck, immediately worried something had happened to Abby, is...

None

Abby's fine, Ben said quickly, knowing both would be concerned and once they relaxed he motioned to a corner of the cafeteria that was empty, may I talk to the two of you in private? He asked hopeful.

None

Uh, yeah, sure, Puck nodded
None

He and Rachel stood up and followed Ben, now more curious and nervous, so, what's going on?

None

Ben took a deep breath, have you talked to your mom today?

None

No
None

I saw her go to school this morning, but that's it
None

Why? Puck wondered.

None

She's stubborn, Ben commented with a sigh, rubbing his forehead, she's been having contractions since she woke up and won't go to the damn hospital.

sigh has no Synonyms in the API
None

What? Puck and Rachel gasped at the same time.

None

Ben nodded, she's been keeping an eye on them, and they're still over thirty minutes apart and she's 'fine', but won't go to the hospital to get looked at
None

Her water hasn't broken, so the pain could be a false alarm, but if it's not, she's gonna have to go
None

I don't think she should be alone and she's refusing to go home
None

I realized something was up when she was sitting with me, Will and at lunch
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She's passing it off and we're all concerned about her
None

I'd stay with her, but I can't get a sub right now, so I was thinking both of you, or at least one of you could hang out with her the rest of the day, he suggested, concerned for his sister.

I'm there, Puck said, does dad know?

None

No
None

Do you really think Ethan would have gone to work, or let her go to work, if he'd known she was having contractions? Ben looked at Puck.

None

Rachel and Puck laughed lightly, no, he wouldn't
None

We'll get our things and go check on her, Rachel said, she'll be able to excuse Noah for his classes, in case he does have to take her to the hospital, but I don't know if she can for me, so we'll have to figure something out.

None

Yeah, do what you have to
None

My phone's on me, so keep me posted
None

If anything, Noah, you could drive her home, because you, Rachel and Jessica came to school in the same car, right? Ben asked.

None

We did
None

She'll be going home, Puck confirmed, even if I have to carry her to the car
None

She doesn't need to be here.

None

I tried to get her to go home, but she won't go
None

She says she has all the medical equipment in her office to check her blood pressure and if it goes up or the baby's heartbeat gets weak, she'll either go right to the hospital or go home to relax
None

She's just being stubborn, Ben sighed.

None

Relax, Uncle Ben
None

We don't need you having a heart attack
None

We'll go check on her and I'll let you know if anything changes, Puck assured him, realizing how worried Ben was for her.

None

Ben nodded and took a deep breath, I think it's the brother thing; especially because we're coworkers, too
None

I'm right here and she's not letting me do anything.

None

Yeah, she gets like that sometimes
None

I don't think she likes asking for help, unless it's absolutely necessary, Puck replied, guiding Ben and Rachel back to where their friends were sitting.

None

Is everything alright? Jessica asked, dad?

None

Mom's possibly having contractions, Puck said simply, so we're gonna see what's up and figure out what we're gonna do.

None

...

None

The teens all understood why Rachel and Puck gathered their bags and soon left the table with Ben right behind them
ben has no Synonyms in the API
['leave', 'table', 'with', 'ben']

As they reached the nurse's office, Puck knocked on the closed door, before pushing it open and found Deborah sitting at her desk, mom! Seriously? Puck asked looking at her.

None

Deborah sighed and glared at her brother, Noah, like I told 

None

, I'm fine
None

Yes, I'm having contractions, but they're still over thirty minutes apart and they're very mild
None

My water hasn't broken, my blood pressure and the baby's heart rate is normal, so for all I know, they're just false labor pains.

None

But you could have at least said something to someone, so we could have checked on you
None

I get you didn't want to sit at home, but if you weren't going to tell dad, because he would have stayed home with you, you could have come to find us, Puck motioned to him, Rachel and Ben, and we could have stopped in between classes.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yes, you're right, I could have done that, but I didn't see a need to worry anyone until it got bad enough to say something
None

This isn't my first time giving birth, you know? Deborah smiled at Puck, and I appreciate the concern, but I'm okay
None

I'm also a nurse and know most of the signs to look for when it comes to complications
None

So far, we're good and I have more equipment here than I do at home, so it's honestly a better place for me, at least for right now.

None

Puck took a deep breath and couldn't help glancing around, realizing she was right, alright, I'll give you that one, but mom; you should have said something.

None

Deborah nodded, getting up carefully and moving around the desk to them, you're right, I should have, but I just didn't want to worry any one, she glanced at her watch, which was currently counting the minutes between her last contraction, it's been about thirty minutes since my last contraction and I could have one anytime
None

They're probably going to get more painful and if they get too bad I'll have to go to the hospital, but right now, there's nothing to do except wait, which is something a lot of us are not good at, she laughed lightly.

None

Rachel couldn't help giggling a little, very true.

None

The bell rang overhead, ending lunch and Puck sighed, I'm not going to class.

None

Realizing her son was not going to budge, she decided to try a different tactic, yes you are
None

The only thing you're going to do up here is watch me finish up some work and inventory my supplies
None

I'll be fine
None

You're welcome to come up and check on me between classes and 

None

 things change, I have my phone, so I can text you, but I'm sure that won't be necessary
None

Emma is also just down the hallway and knows what's going on, so she's around if I have a problem.

None

Noah, she's right
None

She has things under control here and we're only a short distance away if things change
None

We can check in between classes, and make sure things are alright and if they are, at least we wouldn't have missed half a day of classes, though I know we'd both be willing to, Rachel said, looking at Deborah.

None

Puck sighed again and looked at his mom, are you sure you're okay?

None

Yes, I am, she nodded, stepping forward and resting her hands on his shoulders, I'm okay, Noah
None

Even if 'it's time', we still have a long time before it happens.

None

Realizing that his girlfriend and mom were right, and he was nearby in case something did happen, he gave in, alright, but if anything changes, text me
None

I don't care if it's the middle of class or not, okay?

None

I will, I promise, Deborah assured him, looking at Ben and Rachel, I will message you if something changes.

None

...

None

Puck didn't like leaving his mom, but logically knew she and Rachel were right, so he tried to focus on math when he and Rachel got to class, but he was still worried about her
None

Rachel tried to help him stay focused, but it didn't work well and when class was over, she wasn't surprised when he jumped up and left the room quickly, heading off to check on Deborah
None

Confident that Deborah was okay and Puck just needed to reassure himself of that, Rachel headed towards her locker to wait for him.

None

Rachel, how's Deborah? Quinn asked as she reached her locker.

None

Okay, I think
None

Noah went to check on her between classes, Rachel admitted, he's concerned about her
None

I am, too, but even if these are real contractions, they're still over a half an hour apart, so it's not like she's having the baby now
None

There is still a while to go.

None

Wouldn't it be cool if she had the baby before Sunday? Since it's Mother's Day, Jessica smiled.

None

Yes, I think it would be very cool
None

Abby was born just before Mother's Day, so last year, spending it with my newborn daughter was awesome, Rachel smiled at the memory, it was actually my first Mother's Day; well for a 'mom'

I've celebrated it, kind of, with my grandmas and aunts when I was younger, but it's not the same.

Why..

Oh, Jessica blushed, I remember
None

Sorry, it didn't click right away.

None

It's okay, Rachel assured her, I get to celebrate it with Deborah, who's my mom, and my daughter, so it's a wonderful day for me, she glanced down the hallway and saw her boyfriend walking towards her, hey! How's mom?

deborah has no Synonyms in the API
None

She's okay, he shrugged, she had a contraction just after we left her office and one just a bit ago, so this last one was thirty-two minutes from the other one
None

They're getting closer, but she said there's still a long way to go.

None

There is, she nodded, slipping her arm around his waist and kissed him gently, she's gonna be fine, she added, then turned to Jessica and Quinn, we were just talking about how neat it would be if she can have her before Sunday.

None

I was thinking about that, too
None

It is gonna be cool, he agreed
None

I really think she'll have her tonight or tomorrow morning, so we're gonna have to figure out how we're going to work everything, he said, looking at Rachel.

None

What do you mean? She wondered.

None

No matter what time it is, I'm going to be with her and dad for the birth, so I don't know if you want to be up there with your camera, or if you'd rather be at home with Abby, or if your dads want to watch her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Mom doesn't want Arin in the room, so we're gonna have to talk about it after school, he told her.

None

Rachel nodded and waved at the girls as the teens began to move off to their next classes so they wouldn't be late, we can figure something out once we get home.

None

...

None

Now that Puck was a little more relaxed, he was able to focus some more to help Will grade some homework for a few of his Spanish classes
None

When class was over, he and Rachel, who was taking Spanish with Will during the same time Puck was his assistant, went to check on Deborah before their final class of the day
will has no Synonyms in the API
None

Again, she assured them she was fine and agreed to let Puck drive her home after school, because he didn't want her doing that.

None

Heading in different directions for their last class, Puck did his best to stay on task, because of all his classes, this one was his favorite, but he still couldn't help thinking about his mom
None

The topic of discussion that day also seemed to pique his interest, since they were talking about various other types of cops; not just the ones who dealt directly with criminology or forensics, which is what his class was about.

criminology has no Synonyms in the API
None

Mr
None

Anderson, I know this is going to sound like a strange question, but you keep saying you worked for the Detroit SRT
None

What's that stand for? One of Puck's classmates asked.

None

Logan glanced at Puck, you wanna answer that, Puckerman?

None

Special Response Team, Detroit's name for their SWAT team, Puck replied simply.

None

The teens in class all turned to Puck, who was sitting in the back and stared at him surprised, how did you know that? His classmate asked.

None

Because my dad used to be on that team
None

In fact, Mr
None

Anderson used to be his boss, Puck replied, glancing at the older man.

None

Puckerman's right
None

His dad joined my team as a rookie and I worked with him for several years before I left the force, Logan explained, having gotten used to always calling his students by their last name.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

That's so cool! Do you have any stories to share? Someone else asked him.

None

Yes, but we should save that for another day, he motioned to the clock, class is almost out
None

As he finished his statement, the bell rang to end class, no homework tonight, see you all Monday! The teacher called out, glancing at Puck, Puckerman, hang out a second before you leave.

None



None

 Puck mentally groaned, grabbing his things and heading up to the front of the class.

None

I'm sure you have other places to be, so I'll make it quick
None

I've talked to Ethan already, about getting permission, but we also wanted to ask you before we go ahead with making definite plans
None

Sometime before school is out, I'd like my two criminology classes here at McKinley to take a trip to your dad's station, he explained, to let them see all this stuff we're learning about in person
None

Do you think you'd be alright with that? I know about the history with your dad, and he said you haven't been to the station before, so we weren't sure if it was just because you hadn't had an opportunity to or because of something else.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

I have no problem with that, Puck replied, I think it'd be a cool trip
None

I just have never had a chance to go up there
None

He's usually home around the time I get home from school, so I haven't had a need to go to the station, he shrugged.

None

Okay, I'm glad I asked
None

Nothing is decided yet, but now that I know you're okay with it, we can can go ahead with plans
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
plan has no Synonyms in the API

Maybe you two can come up with some ideas, he suggested, I also know your mom is close to giving birth so that's on all of your minds
idea has no Synonyms in the API
None

You don't have to get back to me Monday, but soon
None

We need to figure things out, so we have time to schedule it before the end of the year, Logan told him.

None

Puck nodded in understanding, okay
None

Actually, Mom's been having contractions today, so I'm thinking she may have the baby this weekend
None

Dad and I will have plenty of time to talk, so I'll get back to you.

None

Fair enough
None

Hope everything goes well for you guys, Logan smiled, I know your dad is excited
None

Hope you and your sister are, too.

None

We all are, Puck assured him.

None

Good to hear, Logan nodded, I won't keep you
None

I'm sure you want to go see your mom.

None

A light blush grew on his cheeks, yeah, Puck nodded, I do.

None

...

None

Leaving class after talking to his teacher, Puck made his way to his locker, finding his girlfriend and some of their friends standing around
None

Noah! Everything alright? Rachel asked concerned.

None

Oh yeah, well, I think so
None

Why? He wondered, opening his locker.

None

You normally get here first, Rachel admitted, did you stop to talk to mom?

None

No
None

My teacher wanted to ask me something, Puck replied, switching out a few books.

None

He's the one who used to work with your dad, right? Rachel responded.

dad has no Synonyms in the API
['work', 'with', 'dad']

Yep, Puck nodded and closed his locker, he wants to take his classes to the police station and have him and dad show everyone what we're learning
None

They wanted to make sure I'd be okay with it, which I am, he explained
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

So are you ready? I'm driving mom home
None

Do you mind going to get Abby? He asked her, wanting to get up to his mom.

None

Rachel nodded, I don't mind, but I'll walk up to mom's office with you
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Jessica and TJ had plans after school, so they already left.

None

And we're gonna get going now, but let us know what's going on, Finn said, as he, Quinn and Kurt got ready to go.

None

We will, Puck assured them.

None

Exchanging a few hugs and waves, the teens parted and Rachel and Puck made their way up to Deborah's office, finding her on the phone when they walked in
None

At first they thought she was talking to Ethan, but the more she gave medical terms and information to the person, they realized she might be talking to her doctor
None

After a few moments, she thanked them and said she'd see them later, before hanging up, hey you two, she greeted.

None

Mom, what's going on? Puck asked, worried about everything she had said to the person on the phone.

None

Nothing's wrong, exactly, but my contractions have gotten closer together
None

There is still a long way to go, but I thought I'd call Brad and talk to him
None

He's pretty sure they're the real thing and he's on call tonight
None

As much as I like my obstetrician, I'd rather Brad deliver her
None

I've worked with him for quite a while and I trust him more, she explained, so he said he'd stay at the hospital until we come in.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh, wow, alright
None

That makes sense, Puck nodded, relaxing a little, how close are they?

None

About twenty-five minutes, she replied gathering up a few folders on her desk.

None

So do you think it will be tonight or tomorrow that she's born? Rachel asked curiously.

None

I'm not sure
None

Maybe tonight
None

Sometimes contractions like this can go all day and then the closer they get together, the faster it goes, but sometimes it's the other way, also
None

It all depends on my body
None

It's been quite a while since Arin was born, so even though I'm familiar with pregnancy, my body has changed a lot
None

She'll get here when she gets here, Deborah smiled, standing up and moving to the file cabinet, I have just a few more things to take care of.

None

No hurry, Puck commented, taking a seat on one of the chairs, I'll wait.

None

Rachel smiled, knowing her boyfriend wouldn't leave without Deborah, I could go get Abby and meet you two at home, she suggested.

None

Alright, Deborah nodded, oh, I spoke with Susan earlier and Arin's going to stay there for a while, until we figure out what's going on, she paused, looking at Rachel, Rachel, would you up for being in the room when I have her?

susan has no Synonyms in the API
None

I would be
None

Do you want me to be there? Rachel asked with a smile.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yes, I do, Deborah returned her smile, I was hoping you could take some pictures and video for us, too.

None

I'd be happy to do that
None

I'll talk to my dads about watching Abby so we can both be at the hospital with you and Ethan, Rachel explained, then whenever you have her they can bring Arin and Abby up so they can see her.

None

That sounds like a good idea, Deborah agreed and Puck nodded.

None

Okay, I'll get going
None

See you guys at home in a little bit, Rachel pressed a kiss to her boyfriend's cheek, be good
None

Don't nag on mom
None

She knows what she's doing.

None

Puck blushed, alright, I'll be good.

None

...

None

Picking up Abby and talking with Susan and Arin for a short time, Rachel and Abby returned home, just as Puck and Deborah pulled into the driveway

None

Ethan was already home, so Deborah went right inside and Puck met up with his family, greeting Abby with a kiss on her forehead when she saw him and carried her and her car seat inside

['meet', 'with', 'family']

I figure we could get our things and then go over to mom and dad's, Puck suggested, petting Kona as she met them at the door.

None

Okay
None

We should definitely get our homework done as soon as possible
None

I don't want to be doing it on Mother's Day, Rachel commented honestly, blushing a little.

None

I agree, Puck dropped his bag on the floor and then moved into the living room with Abby still in her car seat, and if mom does have the baby this weekend, we're going to be busy with her, so we won't have time.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

There is that, too, Rachel nodded and followed him, part of me has a hard time believing that your parents are having another child, she admitted.

None

I feel the same way, Puck laughed lightly, it's weird
None

I mean, when she and Abby graduate high school, we'll be what? Mid-thirties? He asked, shaking his head as he freed Abby from her seat and picked her up, I'm starting to feel old, he groaned.

None

Rachel slipped her arm around his waist and rested her head on his upper arm as he held Abby with the other, I assure you, Noah, we're not

None


None

We have so many things to get through and a lot of time to go before we're 

None


None

Though, we will get older, like our parents, but they're not old, either.

None

Puck slipped his arm around her shoulders and kissed her on the lips, I love how you think, he smiled, just like I love you
None

And speaking of 'Mother's Day', you're an amazing mom
None

Abby adores you and there isn't anyone in this world I'd rather have as the mother of my children.

None

Oh, Noah, Rachel felt tears building in her eyes as she snuggled against him, I love you both so much and I love being a mom and your partner and I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives as a family; however large it may grow.

A/N3: Yay, an update! Hope you all enjoyed
None

Please review and let me know! Last update for one of my stories, I only got 3 reviews
None

I appreciate all my readers and I know I'm behind on replying to reviews, but I try the best I can
None

I do read them all and hope you all are still enjoying this
None

I had more planned for this chapter, but decided to split it up
None

This was a good place to stop and the next chapter will be the birth of Puck's sister
None

In a few chapters, once Puck graduates and goes off to boot camp, I'll be doing a time jump to him finishing boot
None

Once Rachel gets back to school, I'll probably do another time jump and hopefully cover her whole Senior year in just a few chapters
None

I think this story is going to end at her high school graduation and the sequel will begin sometime afterward
None

Not sure how I will set it up yet.

None

A/N4: So sorry it's been so long since my last update
None

I thought I was through the worst of it when I had my surgery
None

I healed well from that, but my body had other ideas
None

I started having issues again, so my summer sucked, and have been dealing with the new issues since and then September has been pretty emotional

My dad spent six days in the hospital earlier this month with a serious infection in his foot (long story!)
infection has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'day', 'with', 'infection']

He's home now, (thank God!) on antibiotics, but for a while, we weren't sure if he would lose his foot or not (and if it doesn't heal, he may lose it, which makes me super scared and sad!)
None

My emotions have been on high and with all the stress I've been under (there's a lot of other things going on, too), I've started seeing my psychologist again
None

My dad's issues are constantly changing and it's a mess right now, so there's a lot going on, plus other things keep coming up, so I'm not on the computer as much as I want to be
None

It sucks, because writing calms me down and I hope once things mellow out, I'll be able to get more writing in (I want to, so bad!)
None

I feel horrible my updates are so far apart, but I'm trying the best I can
None

Thank you for all your support and understanding! It really means a lot! I also want to tell you that I promise I'm still here and I'll always love, ship and write Puckleberry
None

I have so many awesome story ideas for them and have 2 WIPs that are not posted that once some of my other fics are finished I can start posting..

A/N2: This story is mostly AU after Mash-up (1x08), but with some of the topics discussed in the later episodes and music used, I may sneak in a conversation, cover the same topic, or use the same song, but I will put my own twist on it and may use some of the music.

Puck and Rachel gathered up their homework, some things for Abby and Kona and soon all of them were over at Deborah, Ethan and Arin's place
None

Puck and Rachel wanted to get their homework done, so while Deborah relaxed on the couch, Ethan and Kona entertained Abby.

None

Ethan wasn't upset that Deborah kept her contractions from him
None

He understood it could take a while and trusted she knew what she was doing
None

He also knew if he'd found out while at work, the distraction could have been a danger to him or others, so it was better he found out when he got home.

None

Deborah's contractions were now about twenty-five minutes apart, but they'd finally started to hurt, more than what she could deal with alone and asked Ethan for some help
None

He gladly rubbed her back and helped her breathe through the pain, which helped relieve some of the pressure, but she still refused to go to the hospital when he and Puck suggested it.

None

When Alan and David got off of work and had a chance to go home to change, they came over to the house to check on everyone, since Rachel had let them know where they would be
None

Once they found everything out, the two men assured Rachel and Puck they'd take care of Abby while they were at the hospital, so the teens could be with Deborah and Ethan.

After dinner, Ben and Arin came over
None

They wanted to check on Deborah and Arin also wanted to get some things so she could stay the night at Ben and Susan's house, just in case it took all night for Deborah to have the baby
None

Deborah and Ethan wanted to have Arin with them during the birth, but Deborah didn't think it was a good idea for her to be up there, in case she saw something that made her uncomfortable
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Arin understood that and spent some time with her mom and family, excited to meet her new sister, just like everyone else was.

mom has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'time', 'with', 'mom']

Arin and Ben went back to Ben and Susan's around seven-thirty, and Deborah was glad they left when they did
None

Deborah contractions were starting to get even worse, were lasting longer and seemed to be closer together, and Deborah was worried that Arin would get scared when she saw her mom in pain.

None

Just after eight, another contraction hit her and this time it was even more painful than before
None

Knowing they'd continue to get worse and her water could break anytime, Deborah knew it was time to go to the hospital
None

Ethan got her overnight bag and they said 'bye' to David, Alan, Rachel, Puck, Abby and Kona and then headed off to the hospital, leaving the others to lock up the house.

None

David and Alan took Abby and Kona home and Rachel and Puck cleaned up a few things in the house, before grabbing their bags, turning the lights off and locking the doors
None

Once back in their home, they put their things away and Rachel collected her camera, some extra memory cards and batteries; she wanted to be ready when they decided to go to the hospital, but for the moment, they were giving Ethan and Deborah a chance to get checked in and to her room before they arrived.

None

Knowing what time it was, David and Alan didn't want to break Abby's nightly routine too much, so they decided to give her a bath and get her ready for bed
None

Since Puck and Rachel would be leaving before they were done, they said 'goodnight' to Abby before they took her upstairs, just in case she got fussy and hard to handle, if they interrupted her bath and she didn't want them to leave.

None

...

None

When they did end up leaving, Rachel drove her and Puck to the hospital and she noticed Puck was more mellow than he usually was, Noah, are you alright? She asked softly.

None

Yeah, Puck nodded, taking a deep breath and sighing, just trying to wrap my head around what's about to happen, he admitted, I know mom's been pregnant, but now we're finally going to meet her, he paused, gathering his thoughts, in just a few hours I'm gonna have another full-sister; not just a half-sister.

None

Did you expect to have half-siblings? Rachel wondered.

None

Puck nodded again and turned to look at her, yeah
None

When I was younger, I figured if mom dated again, she'd end up with someone and Arin and I would have half-siblings
someone has no Synonyms in the API
['end', 'with', 'someone']

I never expected our parents to get back together and have another child
None

It's still sometimes hard to believe it happened, but on the other hand, it's really awesome.

None

It is, Rachel agreed, pulling her car into the parking lot of the hospital, I'm really happy for mom and dad, as well as you and Arin
None

It's a big deal for your..
None

our family, Rachel blushed, still not used to saying 'our' family.

None

Reaching over, Puck rested his hand on her shoulder as she parked the car, it is a big deal and I'm so glad you're here
None

There's no one else I could imagine having with me during this
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

You're amazing and, he smiled, I honestly look forward to when we can give our daughter siblings.

None

Me, too, Rachel agreed as her blush continued to grow and she looked down at her stomach, I know it will be a while, but yes, I do look forward to expanding our family.

None

Puck leaned over, pressed a kiss to her lips and rested his hand on her stomach, I'm glad we feel the same way.

None

Same here, she replied as they pulled apart, and as much as I'd love to continue to talk about our future together, I think we should focus on right now
None

I'm really excited to meet your sister.

None

You're right, he nodded, and I am, too.

None

...

None

Climbing out of the car, Rachel grabbed her camera bag and the two joined hands and headed into the hospital
None

Puck guided her to the maternity wing and once they checked in and were given badges with Deborah's room number, they followed the familiar path to the maternity rooms and came to a stop outside of Deborah's room
number has no Synonyms in the API
['give', 'badge', 'with', 'number']

Ethan saw them arrive, so he motioned for them to come in
None

Hey, how are you doing? Puck asked glancing at Deborah.

None

We're good, Deborah replied, the pain meds are working and I'm already dilated to six centimeters, so it'll be happening soon.

None

Awesome, Puck smiled, taking a seat, have you seen Brad yet?

None

Yeah
None

You just missed him, Ethan commented, he said everything's looking okay, now we're just waiting for her to dilate the rest of the way.

None

Waiting - something we all have problems with, Puck laughed lightly.

None

We do, Deborah agreed, laughing with him, but we won't have to wait too long
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Some women, the closer they are to ten centimeters, the faster they go, and I think that might be happening now
None

I checked myself when I got home from school and didn't seem to be that far, she explained
None

And I've been contracting since this morning.

None

So we might meet her before midnight? Puck wondered.

None

Deborah nodded, it's possible.

None

...

None

Excitement and nerves filled the room as the four of them waited to meet the newest addition to the family and were hoping for a smooth delivery and recovery for Deborah
None

The contractions continued to get closer together, but the meds were diluting a lot of the pain, so Deborah was a lot more relaxed through them
None

A few nurses and Brad stopped in a few times, not only to check on her as a patient, but to also wish her well and congratulations, because she was still friends with many of the staff at the hospital, even if she didn't work there anymore.

None

The closer Deborah got to ten centimeters, the more the nurses got ready for the delivery, making sure the correct supplies were there, arranging some of the furniture and preparing for the clean up of Deborah and the baby
None

A little before ten, Deborah was finally dilated to where she needed to be and a nurse paged Brad to her room.

None

As soon as Brad walked in the room, he checked on her vitals and found her contractions only a few minutes apart, yep, it's definitely time to meet her
None

You guys do have a name picked out, right?

None

They do, they just won't tell anyone until she's born, Puck commented.

None

Well, we won't have to wait long now, Rachel replied with a smile, already filming.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

I know, Puck smirked.

None

The room got busy with several nurses there to assist and one helped Brad into some protective items, like a mask, gown and gloves, then he moved towards the stool he was going to sit on and looked at Deborah and the others, are you guys ready?

nurse has no Synonyms in the API
['get', 'with', 'nurse']

The four family members exchanged glances and Deborah nodded, yeah, we are.

None

...

None

Puck and Ethan took a spot on opposite sides of Deborah to help her sit up and Rachel stood out of the way, but so she had a great view of Ethan, Deborah and Puck, and some of what Brad was doing
None

Also in that time, Deborah's water broke, so besides being dilated, there was no question about it; she was ready to have the baby.

None

Alright, Deborah, as soon as the next contraction hits I want you to push as hard as you can, Brad told her, seeing the baby crowning already.

None

Deborah sat up, with Puck and Ethan each having an arm around her back for support and she gripped onto her their hands as the next contraction hit her
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'puck']

Taking a deep breath, she pushed as hard as she could, feeling some of the pain, even though the medication was still blocking most of it
None

After one painful twinge, she realized the head was free, so she gasped and sunk back into the pillows for a moment, I need a second, she murmured.

None

You're doing great, sweetheart, Ethan murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead.

None

You are, Brad agreed, smiling, I've got the head, he said, carefully supporting the baby
None

On the next push, we'll try to get the shoulders, okay?

None

Breathing heavy for a moment, Deborah nodded and sat up again, just as another contraction built, okay, she replied, tightening her grasp on Ethan and Puck's hands as she again pushed as hard as she could
None

This time when she did, she felt some pressure and then a few tugs and knew the baby's shoulders were free, so she leaned back again to catch her breath, and groaned from the ache.

None

Good job, Deborah
None

The shoulders are out so this should be the last push, but this time, push and hold it, Brad told her encouragingly.

None

She's almost here, mom, Puck smiled happily, you can do this.

None

Thanks, she returned his smile as she continued to breathe through everything that was going on around her
None

Taking another deep breath, she sat up again and looked at her husband, ready?

None

Ethan didn't care that there were tears in his eyes as he nodded and kissed her, I am, he promised.

None

Bearing down as much as she could, Deborah pushed and held it, watching Brad focus
None

As he reach for something, she felt a few tugs and she continued to hold, but she was beginning to lose her strength to continue, please tell me she's close, she begged.

None

You're almost there, Brad assured her, carefully supporting the small body
None

After a few moments, the baby was completely free and he gently turned her over, confirming her gender, it's a girl, he called out, just as she let out a loud cry, which echoed in the room.

None

You did it mom, Puck grinned brightly, wiping his eyes as he looked at his new sister and gently massaged his hand from the pressure she'd had on it.

None

Brad gently laid the crying baby onto a blanket on Deborah's stomach and Deborah reached out, carefully touching her head, welcome to the family, baby girl, she cried happily, relieved to finally have her there.

None

Ethan's tears were now falling, as a build up of many emotions finally spilled free, while he stared at the new life he and Deborah had created
None

I love you so much, Deb, he said softly, pressing a kiss to his wife's lips and hugged her tightly.

None

Deborah happily returned his hug, I love you, too, she smiled, now exhausted, but also full of excitement to be able to hold their daughter soon.

None

Here you go, dad, a nurse said, holding something out to Ethan.

None

For a moment, Ethan looked at her confused, but when he saw the small clamps on the umbilical cord, he knew what was next, so he took the offered scissors and carefully cut the cord
None

She's here
None

She's finally here, Ethan smiled, handing the scissors back once he was done and watched as a nurse scooped the baby up and took her over to a scale and table to check her out, clean her off and measure her.

None

She is and she's beautiful, Deborah agreed, relaxing for a moment as a nurse helped clean her up and check to make sure something wasn't missed.

None

Ethan nodded at her response, she is
None

Just like her mom.

None

...

None

While Puck and Ethan stayed with Deborah for a moment, Rachel continued to film what the nurses were doing with the baby
deborah has no Synonyms in the API
baby has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'what', 'with', 'baby']

Once her weight and measurement had been taken, Rachel ended the video, so she could take a few photos while they were cleaning her up and checking her over
None

While she watched the newborn, all the emotions that she'd had been holding back began to surface, tears falling from her eyes in happiness and excitement.

None

Rachel knew of Deborah and Ethan's past and why they split up, but she also knew what brought them back together years later and the newborn baby was proof of the love they shared
None

To witness her birth was an honor to Rachel and it also helped confirm everything she'd always believed
None

That she and Puck's love, as well as their family bond, would make it through all the rough times ahead
None

It also showed Rachel that she truly was part of the Puckerman family and that meant the world to her.

None

Puck happened to notice Rachel wiping her eyes and now that Deborah was settled into her recovery bed, he moved over to his girlfriend and slipped an arm around her shoulders, you okay, babe? He asked softly.

None

Yes, I am, Rachel nodded, I'm great, actually
None

Through I do admit this is very emotional.

None

Yeah, it is
None

I keep thinking about meeting Abby for the first time and wondering what our next child will be, he admitted, smiling at her.

None

I wondered that, too, but I'm also thinking about what she stands for, she motioned to the newborn currently whimpering and trying to pull her foot away from the nurse putting ink on her foot to get her footprint
None

Undying love and that we can make it, Noah
None

I've always believed it, but she's proof it.

None

She is, he agreed, and we 

None

 make it, he promised, no doubt in his mind.

None

...

None

As the newborn's tiny feet were pressed onto the paper to get her footprints, she continued to fuss, but her cries had subsided a lot now that she was warming up
None

Once the nurse managed to get her prints, she carefully wrapped the baby up in a soft pink blanket and gently put on a matching cap to help her stay warm.

None

Puck pulled his phone from his pocket and took a photo of his new sister, and then he and Rachel watched as the nurse picked up the child and carefully carried her over to her parents, alright, mom and dad
None

Here she is, seven-pounds, eight-ounces and twenty-inches long, the woman told them
None

Who would like to hold her first?

None

I would, Ethan said honestly and Deborah nodded, so he shifted and held his arms out to the nurse
None

The woman carefully laid the newborn in her dad's arms and he made sure to support her head as he sat down on the edge of Deborah's bed, hey there baby girl, he smiled, I'm so glad you're finally here, he said softly, leaning in to press a kiss to her cheek.

None

We all are, Puck commented, as he and Rachel moved closer to them and Rachel snapped a few pictures of Ethan holding her, so, what's her name?

None

Deborah sat up a little and rested her hand on the child's head, Dena Ariel Puckerman, spelled D-E-N-A, she explained, looking up at Puck.

None

That's a beautiful name, Rachel replied.

None

We thought so, but we didn't pick it for a meaning
None

We picked it for the spelling, Ethan admitted, shifting a little so he could hand Dena to Deborah.

None

What do you mean? Puck wondered.

None

When Ethan pointed out the four letters also could stand for Deborah, Ethan, Noah and Arin, we couldn't help picking it, given everything that's gone on with our family, Deborah told them, settling her into her arms, and the 'A' and 'R' in Ariel can be for Abigail and Rachel, too.

family has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'family']

Rachel smiled, you don't have to factor our names into hers, but that means a lot you would consider it
None

I think having just Dena representing her biological siblings and parents is a perfect idea, she replied honestly, continuing to take some photos.

None

Dena, Puck reached out and brushed his finger gently over her cheek, I like it and it also goes along with my name and Arin's because they're all four letters long.

name has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'name']

That, too, Ethan agreed, wiping his eyes.

None

Puck rested his hand on Ethan's shoulder and squeezed it gently, congrats, dad.

None

Ethan smiled at him, then stood up and wrapped his arms around his son in a tight hug, thanks, son.

None

As the two pulled apart, Rachel looked at them, should we let everyone know? It's after ten-thirty and she'll have to get checked out by the pediatrician and all that, so with it being so late, wouldn't it make more sense for everyone to visit in the morning?

None

Yeah, it would, but we should at least let David, Alan, Ben, Susan and the girls know
None

Maybe even Carole, Burt, Finn, Quinn and Kurt, Deborah suggested, then we can tell everyone else in the morning.

None

...

None

As news traveled to those Deborah mentioned, everyone sent their congratulations and promised to visit in the morning, understanding it was late and after the hospital's visiting hours
None

Dena was held for a short time by Rachel and Puck, before she was returned to her parents and the small family sat back to relax
None

It'd been a long and emotional day, but they were glad Dena arrived and very thankful that everything had gone smoothly.

None

A little after eleven, Brad returned to check on Deborah and Dena and to get the birth certificate filled out and signed and soon Dena and Ethan were getting matching hospital bracelets and she was heading off to the nursery to get checked out again
None

The nurse even let Rachel join her, so she could continue to take pictures and also because Rachel wanted to see what they did, since she hadn't seen everything when Abby was born the year prior.

None

Rachel and Dena were gone about an hour, but returned around midnight and by then Dena was hungry
None

Mom and daughter got situated under a sheet, so Puck and Rachel didn't get uncomfortable, were you two planning to stay the night? Deborah asked curiously.

None

We actually haven't talked about it, Rachel replied.

None

You don't have to, if you don't want to
None

I'll be here and Dena's staying in here with us, but you two could go home and sleep in your own bed, Ethan offered.

None

We're all fine and so far everything is going well, so you guys don't need to stick around
None

I'm probably going to fall asleep as soon as she's done, because I'm tired, Deborah explained, and you don't need to stay just to watch me sleep.

None

Are you sure you're okay with us leaving? Puck asked, thinking about it.

None

We are, Deborah nodded, we're so glad you both were here and Rachel, I'm sure, got some amazing photos and video, but we all need to relax and you'll be more comfortable at home.

None

Puck and Rachel exchanged glances, that is true and then dad and daddy can go home and we can meet up in the morning before we all come up here again, Rachel suggested.

Yeah, good idea, Puck agreed, realizing that his dad was there, his mom and sister were okay and knew they were in good hands if something happened, so he nodded at Rachel, alright, we'll go.

None

...

None

After their conversation, Puck and Rachel stayed until Dena was done nursing and then the two said 'goodbye' their parents and the newest Puckerman, before returning their visitor badges and making their way out to Rachel's car.

None

As they walked, Puck put his arm around Rachel and pressed a kiss to her forehead, I love you, Rach.

None

I love you, too, Noah, she replied, um, what was that for? She wondered, unsure what exactly caused him to say it at that moment.

None

Just because, he shrugged, glancing up at the clear night sky, stars twinkling in all directions, tonight was awesome and to share it with you and everything I've been thinking of, I just know that I'm damn lucky to have you and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

Rachel smiled brightly and when they reached her car, she turned around and wrapped her arms around him, stood up on her tiptoes and kissed him, I feel the same way, Noah
None

We're both very lucky, she agreed happily, just as something off in the distance caught her attention, Noah, look! Shooting stars!

None

Streaks of light dashed across the night sky as Puck looked up and he smiled, we should each make a wish, huh?

None

The two fell into silence for a brief moment as they both thought of something to wish for and when Puck finished, he tightened his grip on her and kissed her again, what did you wish for, babe?

None

Rachel shook her head, I'm not telling or it won't come true.

None

Puck nodded in understanding, oh yeah, that's right
None

Then I guess we'll have to wait and see if our wishes come true.

A/N4: I know I just updated this story a few weeks ago and I have several WIPs that need to be updated (I'm working on them, I promise!), but given what today is and because of the topic I had planned for this story, I decided to update 'Out of the Blue' again
None

Besides, what better way to celebrate the story's birthday than with the birth of Puck's sister, Dena! Hope you all enjoyed the chapter
None

Please review and let me know! It is a bit shorter than my usual chapters, but those will return in the next one.

None

A/N5: I have a one-shot I just finished recently that will be posted sometime this month

It's kinda has a Halloween party / theme to it in honor of Halloween coming up, so look out for it!

A/N2: This story is mostly AU after Mash-up (1x08), but with some of the topics discussed in the later episodes and music used, I may sneak in a conversation, cover the same topic, or use the same song, but I will put my own twist on it and may use some of the music.

It was after one-am by the time Puck and Rachel finally got home from the hospital
None

It'd been an emotional day, ending in the birth of Puck's newest sister and the two just went right to bed, not even bothering to wake Rachel's dads, who had stayed to watch Abby.

None

Though sleep came quickly for the couple, time flew by and just after eight-am, Arin was shaking her brother excitedly, Noah! Get up, please! I wanna go to the hospital and meet our sister!

None

Puck jumped at the sudden wake-up call and groaned, Arin? How did you get in here?

None

Uncle Ben walked me over and Alan let me in, she explained, reaching for his hand, come on!

None

Whoa! Just chill out, sis, he murmured, they're not going anywhere.

None

I know, but you already got to see her and I wanna go there with you, Arin told him.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Taking his hand back, Puck rubbed his face and rolled over, seeing Rachel now awake and laughing at the siblings, why are you laughing? We just got woken up.

None

So? It's an exciting day and it's something we're gonna have to get used to, because as soon as Abby is old enough to get out of her crib, she'll be waking us up like this, too, she mentioned, sitting up.

None

Realizing what Rachel said was probably true, he nodded, yeah, I guess we should get used to it, he turned to look at Arin and sat up, okay, we're awake
None

Give us some time to get ready and then we can go.

None

Awesome! Arin grinned, turning and skipping out of their room, happy she'd been successful at her mission.

None

As soon as she was gone, Puck plopped back against his pillows and sighed, someone has had sugar recently.

None

I don't think it's that, Noah
None

She's excited
None

If I was in her shoes, I would be, Rachel smiled, leaning over and kissing him, and she's right
None

We did get to see Dena last night, but she hasn't yet.

None

I know, Puck nodded and wrapped his arms around her, which is why I'm not pissed at her for waking us up, he glanced at the clock, at eight-ten-am.

None

We got to sleep in a little later than we usually do for school, Rachel smiled, relaxing against him for a moment, but then shifted, come on
None

If we're not up and moving soon, Arin may come back.

None

Puck smirked, yeah, she probably will
None

You can go shower first
None

I'll go downstairs and see what's up with everything.

None

Okay, Rachel nodded as the two climbed out of bed, I won't be long.

None

...

None

With Rachel heading for the shower, Puck put on some sweatpants and went downstairs, finding David, Alan, Arin and Abby in the kitchen, hey, he greeted, moving over to his daughter and kissing her forehead, while she ate in her highchair.

None

Good morning, Noah, David responded, we suggested it wouldn't be a good idea to wake you guys up, but Arin insisted.

None

It's alright
None

I get it, he glanced at his sister, just don't make a habit of it, okay? Unless it's an emergency.

None

Alright
None

Promise, she blushed.

None

Thanks for watching Abby, Puck told the guys as he got some water.

None

No problem, Noah
None

We don't mind, Alan assured him, so things went well last night? All we know is what you guys told us in your text messages.

None

Mom did great
None

Dena was doing well when we left and mom sent me a picture of dad holding her this morning, so sounds like things are still good, Puck explained, I hope.

None

I'm sure they are
None

If something happened, they probably would have called someone to let them know, David replied, and she sent us the picture, too.

None

Oh, cool, Puck smiled, leaning against the counter, so Rachel's showering now
None

When she's done, I'm gonna shower and then we can get to the hospital
None

Are you guys going to join us?

None

Actually we're going to go home when you guys go to the hospital
None

We'll get ready and then go meet you guys
None

Ben, Susan and the girls are going to come up at the same time we go and I'm sure Dena and Deborah will be home this evening
None

I can't believe they'd keep them there any longer, David explained.

None

You're probably right, Puck agreed, especially because mom's a nurse.

None

Yeah, and I've heard they don't keep women more than twenty-four hours, if they had the baby naturally, unless there are complications, Alan added, I don't know how true that is, but it does make sense.

None

Quinn and Abby were released within twenty-four hours, so that's probably true, Puck said, wiping Abby's face and hands off with a soft rag after she finished eating
rag has no Synonyms in the API
['hand', 'with', 'rag']

Once she was clean, he picked her up and kissed her cheek, hey there, baby girl
None

You wanna go meet your..
None

Puck paused, oh man, this is gonna be weird, he admitted, now realizing the actual familial relation Abby and Dena had was a bit odd because of their ages.

None

What's wrong? Rachel asked, coming into the kitchen at the end of Puck's comment, so she didn't know what he was talking about.

None

Uh, nothing, really, Puck admitted, but I just..
None

I mean I knew it'd be weird, but we've never talked about exactly what Dena and Abby are going to be to each other
None

Biologically, Dena is Abby's aunt, but Abby's a year older and they're going to be growing up together.

None

I don't think we need to have a title right now
None

I understand what you're saying, but as they get older, they'll learn their relation
None

They'll call each other by their first names and, Rachel blushed, for some reason I imagine when they're teenagers Dena will tease Abby about being her aunt and Abby will tease her, too, for being her niece, but being older.

None

You've been thinking about this, haven't you? Puck smiled, slipping his free arm around her shoulders, I can see that happening, too, now that you mention it.

None

It's fun to think about their future, so yes, I have been thinking of it
None

I knew it was something we'd bring up, but right now, I don't think it's super important we focus on it
None

They're family and that's all they need to know right now, Rachel admitted, or at least that's what I'd figured out.

None

Puck pressed a kiss to her lips, I get it and I guess you're right
None

It isn't really important to have an exact plan right now
None

We'll figure it out later.

None

...

None

Talking for a short time, Puck eventually headed upstairs to get ready for the day, while Rachel took care of Abby
None

After they were all ready, it wasn't long before Rachel, Puck, Abby and Arin were on their way to the hospital and when they arrived, they found Quinn sitting in the room talking with Deborah, while Ethan was on the phone.

deborah has no Synonyms in the API
None

Arin went right over to Deborah, while Rachel and Puck moved further into the room towards Quinn, hey Quinn
None

I didn't know you'd be here, Rachel admitted in surprise.

None

Hey, Quinn smiled, Carole and I stopped by this morning before she had to go to work
None

I decided to stay, because I didn't want to be alone in the house.

None

Is Finn working at the shop with Burt this weekend? Rachel wondered, setting the diaper bag in her hand down on an empty chair.

None

Yeah, and Kurt and Ryan had plans, she confirmed, hope you don't mind.

None

I don't, Puck assured her as he sat Abby's car seat down on the same chair that Rachel had put her diaper bag.

None

Neither do I, Rachel added, taking Abby out of her car seat, have you held Dena yet?

None

Yeah, she's adorable and her name is awesome
None

It's perfect for her, she replied honestly.

None

As Rachel and Quinn continued to talk, Puck moved over to his mom and greeted her with a hug and kiss, hey mom
hug has no Synonyms in the API
None

How are you doing?

None

We're doing really well, she smiled, so far no complications from the birth for me and Dena has been sleeping for a little while
None

The last few times they've come to check on her, she's responded like she should, so if things continue to go that way we should get out of here by dinner time.

None

That's awesome, Puck smiled, glancing over at Dena in the bassinet, just in time for Mother's Day.

None

Exactly, she nodded with a grin, you know, last year at this time, I definitely didn't think this is how we'd be celebrating Mother's Day this year, but I'm not complaining
grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

She's perfect, just like you two are, she explained, looking at Arin and Puck.

None

Well, I wouldn't say perfect, but we have our moments, Puck smirked.

None

Eye of the beholder, Noah, Deborah replied.

None

True, he agreed, looking at Arin, did you tell her what you did this morning?

None

Arin blushed, Uncle Ben walked me over to Noah and Rachel's and I woke them up
None

I wanted to come up here with him and I didn't want them to sleep all morning.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh, I don't think they would have slept all day, Deborah admitted with a light laugh, but I'm sure they understand your reasoning behind the wake-up.

laugh has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, we do, and I asked her not to make a habit of it, Puck replied, unless it's an emergency.

None

I won't
None

I'm just excited, Arin said, can I hold her?

None

Sure, Deborah nodded, she's probably going to be hungry soon, so Noah could get her? Your dad is talking to your grandma and aunts, she explained, motioning to where Ethan was, sitting in the corner of the room talking on his phone.

None

Puck nodded and moved over to the bassinet, seeing Dena wrapped up in a soft pink blanket and wearing a matching pink cap
None

Her eyes were open slightly, so he carefully picked her up and carried her over to Deborah's bed where Arin was now sitting on the edge, remember to be careful.

None

I know
None

I held Abby when she was born, Arin reminded him, carefully holding out her arms.

None

Laying their newborn sister in Arin's arms, Puck smiled, Arin, meet our baby sister.

None

Arin looked down at her, hi, Dena! I'm really glad you're finally here, she grinned, I never thought I'd get to be a big sister, but it's so cool!

None

Noah, take a picture, Rachel motioned to the camera sitting on a rolling table by Deborah's bed.

None

Puck smirked at Rachel's suggestion, but did what she suggested, snapping a few photos of his sisters, while adding, and I never thought I'd ever have another sister, so it's really cool.

None

Before anyone could respond to what Puck said, Ethan's side of the conversation he was having with his family didn't seem to be going well, ...Mom..
family has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'with', 'family']

No..
None

I don't think..
None

Mom, seriously, we're fine and we don't..
None

he sighed, rubbing his forehead as he listened to his mom on the phone, I know that, but..
None

Are you sure? I..
None

We didn't plan anything big for tomorrow because..
None

Alright, alright, fine..
None

See you later, he muttered, hanging up the phone and shaking his head.

None

Everything alright? Puck asked, looking over at him.

None

Well, my sisters and brother are all excited about Dena
None

They send their congratulations and everyone can't wait to meet her at the end of the month when we, Ethan motioned between him and Deborah, celebrate our birthdays like we did last year
None

Standing up, he rubbed his neck and continued, my mom is just as excited, but she doesn't want to wait until the end of the month, so she's coming down, glancing at his watch to see the time, he did some mental figuring, and I expect her here by dinner.

None

What? Deborah gasped, today? How long is she planning on staying?

None

Ducking his head, Ethan bit his lip, until Monday, he murmured, knowing she wouldn't hear him from where he was standing.

None

Ethan, how long is she staying? Deborah asked again, trying to stay calm as her thoughts began to race.

None

She doesn't plan to leave until Monday
None

I tried to talk her out of it, and so did my sisters, but she's determined to come see us
None

She never got to see Noah, Arin or Abby when they were born and she wants to spend Mother's Day with us
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She's spent many of them with my siblings and their families, but she's never spent any with you guys, he looked at Arin and Puck
sibling has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'many', 'with', 'sibling']

I know this is short notice and I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't change her mind, he added, hoping his wife wouldn't get mad.

None

As Deborah's mouth fell open in shock, everyone else just remained stunned and focused on the two adults
None

They figured it was best to let them talk about the situation and they also didn't know how Deborah would react.

None

While Ethan spoke, Deborah contemplated what he was saying
None

It'd been a long twenty-four hours and she was still tired; the bed was not the most comfortable, so at the moment all she wanted to do was go home with her family and sleep
family has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'family']

She had thought briefly that they may have some guests visiting, but she didn't expect it to be so soon
None

After Ethan mentioned all the missed opportunities Orla could have had with Puck and Arin, and the missed Mother's Days, she completely understood why she was so determined to visit
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'with', 'puck']

Alright, she took a deep breath, I'm not thrilled she's coming down here on such short notice, but I get it
None

If I was in her position, I'd probably do the same thing, given the history our family has, she admitted, I like her, don't get me wrong, but I just gave birth
None

I'm tired and I just would like to sleep and relax, so you guys are gonna have to help out, she looked around at her kids, before landing her gaze on Ethan, and see
None

It's a good thing we finished cleaning out the guest room and setting up the furniture last month
None

I had a feeling this might start happening after she was born.

None

I didn't think we'd need it this soon, but yeah, you were right, he agreed, but we still don't have any bedding
None

That was what you were going to get.

None

Deborah thought for a moment and then turned to Rachel, do you think you could make a trip to the store for us?

None

Uh, sure
None

For what? Rachel wondered.

None

Sheets and a comforter of some sort
None

I think we have similar tastes, so you can go to the house and see the finished product and get an idea, before heading to the store, but I believe you'd pick out something similar to what I'd go for, Deborah admitted.

None

I'd be happy to
None

I'll even take Quinn
None

Between the two of us we should be able to find something that will work, Rachel replied with a smile, happy to be asked to do something like that for her.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Thank you, Deborah returned her smile and relaxed for a moment, but noticed Dena was getting restless in Arin's arms, I'll take her
None

I think she's getting hungry.

None

Oh, okay, Arin carefully turned and handed her over and then stood up and hugged Ethan.

None

Ethan returned her hug and then pulled his walled out and handed Rachel some cash, thanks for doing that.

None

It's no problem, Rachel replied, taking the money, but I don't think we'll need this much.

None

You might need to get an alarm clock, and I'd rather you have too much than not enough, he told her, you're doing a big favor for us and if you want, you can use the rest for lunch.

favor has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel blushed, but slid the money into her jeans' pocket, alright
None

We'll go when my dads get here, which should be anytime, she turned to look at Quinn, I guess I should have asked you if you'd like to go.

None

Quinn laughed lightly, it's alright and I'm fine with going
None

Sounds fun
None

We haven't hung out for a while.

None

...

None

When David and Alan arrived, Rachel explained what she and Quinn were doing and soon the two teen girls and Abby were on their way to Deborah and Ethan's to see the spare room and then headed off to the store
None

Puck kept them updated on what was going on at the hospital and after the girls had finished their shopping trip, they went back to Rachel and Puck's
None

They washed the sheets and while they waited for them to finish, they went over and picked up Deborah and Ethan's place a little bit more than had been done the night before.

None

By one that afternoon, Quinn and Rachel had finished washing and drying the sheets, making the bed in the spare room and setting up the alarm clock they'd gotten, all while Abby napped and Rachel kept her baby monitor with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Once they finished at Deborah and Ethan's, they headed back to Rachel and Puck's house and ordered some Chinese take-out for lunch
None

They thought about going out, but with Abby sleeping, they didn't want to wake her up just for that and they'd heard from Puck that Deborah and Dena could be released in the next few hours, so they figured by the time Abby was awake, they might be home.

None

So how are you doing? Quinn asked curiously as they waited in the living room for their lunch delivery.

None

I'm fine, why do you ask? Rachel wondered, surprised at the question.

None

Quinn looked at her, with time ticking down, I mean.

None

Rachel shrugged, oh, I'm alright
None

I'm staying positive right now
None

We've got a lot of time left before he leaves and I plan to enjoy it without being upset
None

I can be upset once he's in boot camp.

None

I'm glad you're able to hold off on that
None

I don't know if I'd be able to, Quinn replied.

None

I don't know if I'll be able to, either, but I'm hoping I can, Rachel admitted honestly
None

I don't want Noah to see how upset I am
None

He knows it's going to be hard on all of us and showing him how upset I am is going to make him feel worse.

None

Quinn nodded in understanding, yeah, I see what you mean
None

If you ever do get upset and don't want him to see, you know where to find me.

None

Thanks, Rachel smiled, I may take you up on that offer.

None

...

None

When their lunch arrived, Quinn and Rachel sat down to eat and finished up just before Abby woke up from her nap
None

Puck had also messaged during their meal, saying that Deborah and Dena would be released from the hospital shortly and they'd probably all be home in an hour
None

With that news, Rachel and Quinn cleaned up their dishes and put things away, and then hung out with Abby and Kona until Puck and his family got back home.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

As soon as several cars pulled up to the house, Rachel knew everyone was home, so she, Quinn, Abby and Kona went over to meet them
None

Ethan and Deborah were the first to head inside, but the others followed, and Dena's close family headed right into the nursery as they settled Dena into her crib for the first time
None

She'd slept most of the way home and woke up only when they took her out of her car seat
None

She seemed interested in her surroundings, but it wasn't long before she was drifting off to sleep again, so Ethan turned on the baby monitor and then they headed back into the living room to meet up with the others there.

other has no Synonyms in the API
None

Since Deborah and Ethan hadn't gotten much sleep the night before, they had something quick to eat, talked with their family for a short time and then headed to bed for a while
family has no Synonyms in the API
['talk', 'with', 'family']

They knew Ethan's mom would be there a little after four, and Ethan at least wanted to have a short nap before she arrived.

None

Along with Rachel, Abby, Puck, Quinn and Arin at the house, was also Rachel's dads, Deborah's brother and his family
None

They stayed for a bit, but Ben and Susan left with Hannah and Arin
hannah has no Synonyms in the API
None

Arin wanted to pack her things up from staying over the night before and Jessica stayed to hang out with her cousin and friends and to keep from waking Ethan, Deborah or Dena, everyone moved back over to Rachel and Puck's place
cousin has no Synonyms in the API
['hang', 'with', 'cousin']

Since they didn't have anything planned to do, the teens and Rachel's dads popped in a movie to watch, but they spent more time talking over the movie than actually paying attention to it, since it was one they'd already seen several times.

None

Ben walked Arin back home around three-thirty and once she dropped her things off at her house, they joined the others at Puck and Rachel's
None

After talking together for a short time, they went back to the other house because they knew Orla would be arriving soon and someone would have to figure out what to make for dinner
None

Ben and Jessica decided to go home, giving the Puckerman-Berry family some time alone
None

Quinn stayed, and had gotten a call that Finn would be home soon, so Puck and Rachel invited him over and he agreed to join then, but wanted to shower first, so he'd be over when he could.

None

Ethan got up just before four and between him, Rachel and Puck they came up with something to make for dinner and while they got started, they also talked about brunch and dinner for the next day
something has no Synonyms in the API
None

It was Mother's Day and they'd planned on it doing special meals because Rachel and Deborah didn't want any gifts or for them to do anything big.

None

Finn arrived at the same time Orla got there and while he easily settled in with the family, Orla was super excited to meet Dena, but was also glad to have some time with her other grandchildren, who she'd never got to see growing up
family has no Synonyms in the API
['settle', 'with', 'family']

She also was happy to spend time with her first great-grandchild, Abby, to get to know more about Rachel and to spend time with her son, daughter-in-law and the rest of their family

She usually was only around during family parties or events, so it was harder to get a lot of one-on-one time and now she had a chance to have that.

Did you see dad's face when grandma asked if Dena was their last kid? Puck asked later that night as he and Rachel were getting into bed.

None

Rachel laughed lightly, I did
None

It's a good thing he wasn't drinking anything, because he probably would have choked on it
None

Though, I have been curious if she is their last child
None

I mean, there's time for them to have more, if it's something they wanted to do.

None

Puck groaned, hopefully Dena is it
None

I love my parents and my sisters, but it's gonna be weird when we have more kids, if my parents are still having them.

None

I guess I see you're point
None

It'd be the same as if my dads decided to adopt a baby now that I'm out of the house, she admitted.

None

Exactly, Puck nodded, wrapping his arms around his girlfriend and pulling the blankets over them, don't get me wrong, if they had more, I wouldn't complain, but some how I think she's it, though, Dena was unexpected, so we don't really know, he smirked.

None

There is that, she agreed with a smile, then blushed, speaking of unexpected, I'm surprised we haven't had a, um, I guess it's called a scare
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

The only thing protecting us is my birth control.

None

Yeah, I've thought about that, too, he pressed a kiss to her lips, I love you and Abby, but I don't want any more kids right now.

None

Same here, she assured him, I admit I've thought about what it'd be like to have more, but we've got plenty of time for that.

None

Puck nodded, I know what you mean, he gently moved his hand down to rest on her stomach, but I've wanted to see you pregnant
None

I didn't get that with Abby, he admitted honestly, I know you're gonna be gorgeous, but seeing it is different than just thinking about it
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Not only that, but we'll have the experiences we didn't get with Abby before she was born
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Yeah, we got it a little with Quinn, but it's not really the same.

quinn has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel smiled, joining her hand with his, we'll get that one day, but I've figured out that I'm fine with not getting all the physical experiences of being pregnant with Abby
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

That's just a part of it; it's honestly nothing compared to being her mom for the rest of her life
None

That's what's important to me; but of course I want to to experience pregnancy, too
None

I guess I just mean it's okay, because I know we'll get that one day.

None

This is why I love you, babe, Puck kissed her, from the start, you've been so supportive of the situation and easily accepted Abby as your own
None

I could not ask for a better person to be with
None

I don't deserve you, but I'm not letting you go.

None

Neither am I, Noah, and I love you, too, she grinned, and don't worry
None

You're stuck with me for good.

Waking up Sunday morning, also Mother's Day, Rachel was surprised to find the other half of the bed empty
None

She then noticed the baby monitor was missing from where it had been when they went to sleep the night before, so she was curious what Puck and Abby were up to
None

Glancing at time, she saw it was around nine-thirty, so she knew her boyfriend had gotten up early to take care of Abby, giving her a chance to sleep in
None

Getting up, Rachel put her slippers and a robe on and headed downstairs in search of her family.

None

Morning! Happy Mother's Day, babe, Puck smiled from the living room floor, where he was sitting watching Abby walk around the room.

None

Good morning and thank you, she smiled brightly at him and Abby, you didn't have to let me sleep in.

None

I know, but it's Mother's Day, so I wanted you to have the morning off
None

Besides, it gives me some extra time with Abby, Puck replied hugging Abby, then pulled something from behind him and handed it to her, go give it to mommy, he murmured, pointing to Rachel.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Abby took the suggestion and with the item in her hand, turned and walked towards Rachel, holding it out, rose, she grinned, having just learned the word earlier that morning.

['take', 'suggestion', 'with', 'item']

Rachel smiled and picked Abby up, kissing her cheek, yes, that is a rose, she agreed, taking the red flower from her daughter, thank you
None

It's very pretty
None

Where did you get it?

None

Puck stood up and moved over to them, there's plenty more in the kitchen, he replied, wrapping his arms around her and Abby.

None

Really? She blushed, you got me flowers?

None

Yep
None

I had them delivered earlier
None

I know you didn't want anything, but it's a special day
None

And well, I wanted to 'just because', he admitted, guiding them into the kitchen to show her the vase of red roses sitting on the kitchen table.

None

Oh, Noah, they're beautiful! She slipped her arm around his back and hugged him and Abby, I don't mind getting flowers; I just didn't need a bunch of gifts
None

Last year what you guys got me was wonderful, but not necessary, she explained, standing up a little to kiss him on the lips, thank you.

None

Welcome, he grinned, returning her kiss, and I had a feeling you'd be okay with these.

these has no Synonyms in the API
None

Abby squirmed a little at being so close to her parents, which caught Rachel's attention, oh, sorry, sweetie, she kissed Abby on the cheek and stepped a few inches back from Puck so Abby wasn't squished between them.

None

Brunch is in about forty-five minutes, so if you want to get ready, I can watch her, Puck suggested.

None

Oh, yeah, I'll go do that, she kissed Abby once more, before handing her to Puck, have you talked to your mom yet?

None

Definitely, Puck nodded, and talked to grandma
None

Abby and I actually went over for a short visit
None

Mom was up with Dena.

dena has no Synonyms in the API
None

Ah, I see
None

How is mom doing? Rachel wondered.

None

She's alright
None

I think she's still amazed that she had a baby the other night, Puck replied.

None

That's understandable, but what a way to celebrate Mother's Day! I mean, Abby was born just a week before it last year, so it was amazing to celebrate it with my new daughter and now mom's got another kid to celebrate with, it's gonna be awesome for her.

daughter has no Synonyms in the API
['celebrate', '-PRON-', 'with', 'daughter']

It will, he agreed, guiding her towards the stairs, go on, I got this down here
None

I told mom we'd be over by ten-thirty and that's when your dads will be over, too.

None

Kissing Puck and Abby once more, Rachel nodded, alright, love you both.

None

Puck lifted Abby's hand up to wave at Rachel, we love you, too.

None

Gathered around Deborah and Ethan's dinning room table, the Berry and Puckerman family, with the addition of Ethan's mom, Orla, settled in to a nice Mother's Day brunch
addition has no Synonyms in the API
['gather', 'with', 'addition']

Abby was content in the playpen Ethan and Deborah had for her and Kona was keeping an eye on her
None

Dena had been fed and was napping at the moment, giving the teens and adults a chance to relax and enjoy their meal.

None

With light conversations, the family took their time to eat and as they fished, the dads and Arin did the dishes, so Rachel, Deborah and Orla could take it easy
None

While the dishes were being done, Deborah got something from the counter and handed Rachel an envelope, wait until the guys are done to open it, but this is for you and Noah.

None

Really? Rachel eyed the envelope, for both of us?

None

Yeah, Deborah nodded, we were going to wait to give this to you guys, but we decided to give it to you now.

None

Oh, alright, Rachel contemplated the contents of the envelope, I'm definitely curious what's inside.

None

The three women patiently waited for everyone to finish up in the kitchen
None

When the guys and Arin did get done, they came back to the table and Puck went to get Abby from her playpen to sit with them and as he sat down, he noticed the envelope in front of Rachel, what's that, babe? He asked, settling Abby on his lap.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I don't know
None

Mom said it's for us and I should wait until everyone is back before opening it, Rachel admitted.

None

We're considering it an early birthday present for both of you, David added.

None

Nodding, Rachel opened the envelope and pulled out a few pieces of paper
None

Unfolding them, she skimmed over it's contents and gasped when she realized what it was, oh wow! You got us a weekend away?

None

For the last weekend of this month
None

Over the three-day weekend, Ethan confirmed.

None

But isn't that the weekend we're doing your birthday party? Puck asked, glancing at his parents, before looking at the papers in Rachel's hands.

None

It is, but we picked Saturday night and Sunday night, so you guys can go to the party and leave from there to get away
None

Then you can come home on Monday, and you won't miss any school since there's no school that day, Alan commented.

None

Thank you, Rachel smiled brightly, I didn't know if we'd get a chance to have any time like this before Noah left, she admitted, looking at her boyfriend.

None

Yeah, same here
None

Thanks everyone, Puck returned Rachel's smile.

None

You're welcome
None

We were originally going to spring it on you at the party, but we know it's hard to leave Abby, so we decided to give it to you early, so you at least know about it, Deborah explained, and there's a lot going on the last few weeks of school, so we wanted to make sure that you had a chance to spend some quality time together before Noah leaves for boot camp.

None

We also hope that you don't mind going to Sandusky again, like you did before Abby was born
None

We remembered you guys liked where you stayed and being related to the concierge manager has it's perks, Ethan added with a smile, she upgraded your room and you now have a suite overlooking the bay.

smile has no Synonyms in the API

Oh wow, Rachel grinned, I don't mind at all!

None

I'm open to anywhere and it sounds awesome, Puck smiled at their parents, thank you
None

This is a great gift
None

It'll be nice to have a weekend to ourselves, he said, looking at Rachel, even though I know both of us will miss you like crazy, he added, looking down at Abby in his lap.

None

Rachel reached over and brushed her finger over Abby's cheek and then tickled her stomach a little, I'll definitely miss you, but I'm going to enjoy the weekend away
None

Thank you all so much, she said again, it's a wonderful gift.

My depression and anxiety has really flared up, which keeps me unfocused, so it's hard to settle in to write without getting distracted
None

On top of that, some bad news was dropped on me last week
None

There is a possible cancer scare with someone in my family (remember my mom had cervical cancer back in 2010 and beat it?)
None

I don't know what this scare will bring and I'm praying it's not cancer, but we won't know any more details until more tests are done
None

I'm not saying who the person is, because they don't want anyone to know right now

I'm sharing this with you all now, in case my updates continue to be so far apart, so you'll have an idea why.

Mother's Day was just what Rachel and Deborah wanted; simple and relaxing
None

The gift Puck and Rachel got from their parents as an 'early birthday present', was more than they ever expected, but were both already looking forward to the getaway
None

They knew they'd miss Abby, but it would be their last weekend together, away from home at least, before Puck headed off for boot camp at the end of June.

None

As the weekend came to a close and the new week began, the family put aside the eventful beginning to May, with Abby's first birthday, Dena's arrival and Mother's Day, to return to a normal pace
birthday has no Synonyms in the API

Orla stayed, as promised, until Monday, when she returned home
None

Her visit had been short and sudden, but they were happy to see her and invited her back any time.

None

The biggest change was for Deborah
None

For the last several years, she had worked a regular job and now being on maternity leave for the rest of the school year was strange for her; especially because everyone else was back to school or work
None

She definitely enjoyed the time with her newborn daughter, but did miss seeing the rest of her family
None

Her sister-in-law, Susan, who watched Abby for Rachel and Puck, spent a lot of time at Deborah and Ethan's with Abby, giving the two women an opportunity to have adult conversations and to spend time together, since they get along so well.

At school, the Glee Club focused on practicing for the annual concerts at the middle schools, where new McKinley students came from
None

Those performances, as well as the day and night concerts at McKinley were coming up starting the last day of May and going into the first few days of June, just before prom
None

They also were figuring out what songs to sing at graduation and it didn't take long for set lists to be made for their various performances
None

This gave them a chance to focus on practicing and getting ready for all their end-of-the-year concerts.

None

Teachers were handing out last minute assignments for all the students
None

Many decided to just add a research paper to the end of the year work, while others doubled up on lessons to make sure everything they wanted to cover had been completed
None

All the Seniors were all being watched extra carefully to make sure their grades didn't slip to a failing grade, that could keep them from graduating and thankfully none of the Glee Club Seniors were in danger of that happening.

None

Graduation plans were already underway and the Seniors were picking up their caps and gowns, which made the coming event even more real for everyone
None

Just seeing Puck trying them on at home was enough to bring tears to Deborah's eyes
None

Having just had Dena, memories of Puck and Arin as newborns had been fresh in her mind and remembering a newborn Puck and comparing him to the soon-to-be high school graduate was an emotional moment for her
None

Rachel knew things were changing and after seeing him trying those items on reminded her how soon those changes would happen
None

It was definitely an emotional time, because she realized things were happening soon and it wasn't just being talked about; all of their discussions and thoughts were becoming a reality.

None

While his mom and girlfriend were focused on all the changes that were going on, for the first time since he'd gotten it, Puck pulled out his class ring
None

He'd purchased it the year before, just after his dad had given him and Rachel all that money
None

It'd been delivered over the summer, but he didn't wear it, choosing to just wear the rings that related to his family, but now that graduation was getting closer, he decided to wear it until school was out, along with his other rings.

Deborah and Ethan's birthdays were coming up at the end of May
None

Both would be turning thirty-seven and they were having a big party at one of the local parks to celebrate with friends and family, and to introduce Dena to everyone, similarly to the year before when they introduced Abby to everyone at their party, though this year, it wasn't a surprise
friend has no Synonyms in the API
['celebrate', 'with', 'friend']

Plans were well underway and Ethan and Deborah's various friends and family would be joining the party, along with the Glee teens and other mutual friends they had in Lima.

None

As the last Saturday of May arrived, it was party day, but it was also a big day for Puck and Rachel
None

Later, after they'd had some time to spend with friends and family, the young couple would head up to Sandusky to spend a few nights away from home.

friend has no Synonyms in the API
['spend', 'with', 'friend']

Having the party at a local park, the large group of family and friends had plenty of parking and room to hang out and enjoy the late-Spring day
None

Dena and Abby were definitely getting most of the attention, seeing how much Abby had grown since people had last seen her last and with meeting Dena for the first time.

None

The year before had been filled with nervous butterflies, because Ethan's family was meeting Puck and Arin for the first time, and also seeing him and Deborah back together after many years apart
butterfly has no Synonyms in the API
['fill', 'with', 'butterfly']

It was a big moment for the Ballard-Puckerman family, and now those nerves were gone
None

They'd had many opportunities over the past year to hang out and to get to know each other
None

The cousins were all friends and enjoyed hanging out and the adults were in the same place; comfortable with each other.

None

Aside from the birthdays and seeing Abby and Dena, a big topic of conversation was graduation
None

Puck, and Ethan's brother's twins, Logan and Laura, were all graduating that year, so the families were not only emotional about that, they were also trying to come up with a day they could have a family graduation party, because it turned out the twins were graduating the same day as Puck, so they wouldn't be able to attend the others' graduation
day has no Synonyms in the API

They settled on a party, so the adults agreed to figure out plans later on, when the cousins had more time to figure out what they wanted to do.

A little after two Saturday afternoon, Bree walked over to Puck and Rachel
None

They were sitting with some of their friends and cousins at one of the picnic tables in the shade, talking lightly, while Abby slept soundly in her car seat on the table, hey you two, Bree greeted quietly, so she didn't wake Abby up.

some has no Synonyms in the API
None

Hey, Puck smiled, what's up?

None

Not much
None

I wanted to give you guys this, she said, handing something to him.

None

Puck raised a curious eyebrow and took a name tag from her, reading the name on it, 'Brianna Olsen - Concierge Manager', and laughed lightly, why are you giving us your name tag?

None

She joined his laugh and smiled, so when you check in they know who you are
None

I told them my nephew and his girlfriend would be staying there for a few nights, so to treat them right and that you'd give them my name tag when you got there.

None

Oh, alright, Puck nodded, shifting to pocket the item so it didn't get misplaced, thanks.

None

No problem, she smiled, leaning over to smile at Abby, she finally gave up, huh?

None

Yeah, with so many things going on, she stayed awake as long as she could, Rachel replied, adjusting the blanket over Abby, and I hate for us to leave without her being awake, but I don't want to disturb her.

None

You guys have time
None

No hurry, Bree admitted, it's only a two-hour drive.

None

Yeah, but I'd like to go soon, Puck added, so we can get up there before it gets dark
None

I know it's a holiday weekend, so it's gonna be busy and neither of us know our way around there very well.

None

Understandable, she agreed, if you have any problems you can always call.

None

We'll keep that in mind
None

Thank you, Rachel smiled, and thank you for upgrading us.

None

Bree nodded, no problem
None

I hope you guys enjoy your room
None

It has a really nice view.

None

That sounds wonderful
None

Our last room was nice, so I'm sure we'll enjoy this one, too, Rachel replied.

None

Puck nodded, glancing at Rachel, we did have a nice place
None

Can't wait to see this one.

None

...

None

The party began to die down a little after Puck, Bree and Rachel started talking
None

Some locals and a few of the out-of-town guests were first to leave, including Ethan's former teammates from Detroit
None

They also made sure to say 'goodbye' and 'good luck' to Puck, because they weren't sure if they'd see him before he went off to boot camp, though Puck and Nate would continue to talk often, like they had been through Facebook and text messages for over a year
None

Puck was glad to have someone to talk to who had been through exactly what he was planning to do in the Navy, but their friendship wasn't just because of that; they had similar interests in other things so they got along well.

None

With everyone slowly leaving, Puck and Rachel realized they should get going
None

Abby was still asleep and they didn't want to just leave her at the party with her dads, who were staying at the house to watch her, so they talked to their parents about what to do
dad has no Synonyms in the API
['leave', '-PRON-', 'with', 'dad']

David offered to return home with them, and they could settle their daughter in her crib for the rest of her nap before they left
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Thankful for the suggestion, the teens shared hugs with their parents and siblings and then made their way home.

parent has no Synonyms in the API

Once they got back, Puck and Rachel took Abby up to her room and when Puck took her out of her car seat, she woke up from the movement
None

The teens gently said 'goodbye' and laid her down and waited until she fell back to sleep before they got ready to leave.

None

...

None

By three-thirty, Puck and Rachel were on their way to Sandusky in Rachel's car
None

It was a trip they'd taken in the past, so they were familiar with the drive and it gave them more time to take in the scenery they passed on their way
None

They'd only been out of town about ten minutes when Puck saw Rachel wiping her eyes and he knew why she was upset, so he reached over and rested his hand on her shoulder, it's okay, babe
None

It's just a few days.

None

I know, she murmured, taking a deep breath, it's just hard
None

She's used to us going to school and coming home after a few hours
None

Tonight we're not gonna be there to give her a bath or put her to sleep
None

I know our parents have watched her in the past, but it's...

None

Rubbing her shoulder, Puck squeezed it gently, I know, he replied, glancing at a sign for another town, if you're too upset to go, we can go home, babe
None

I can turn around at the next exit.

None

No, don't do that, she shook her head, looking at him, I want to go
None

I want to be alone with you
None

I just need a few moments, that's all, she assured him, reaching up to take his hand in hers, I definitely wouldn't turn down a weekend with you.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Puck smiled lightly and squeezed her hand, she's gonna be fine
None

She'll wonder where we are, but we'll be home soon and I'm sure we can get her a bunch of stuff while we're gone.

None

Rachel blushed, I was planning on that.

None

Great minds think alike, he winked, letting a few moments of silence pass before letting go of her hand to brush along her cheek, so you good? Or should I pull over to kiss you better? He wondered with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API

A light chuckle escaped her lips and she shook her head, no, you don't have to pull over
None

Save it until we're in our room
None

I'm okay
None

I just needed a few moments to get it out of my system.

None

Understandable, but just know if you have second thoughts, say something, okay? He glanced at her as they joined hands again.

None

Rachel nodded happily, I will
None

Thank you, Noah.

None

Getting through her emotions and relaxing, Rachel contemplated their weekend and got an idea for when they arrived, but kept it to herself; she wanted to surprise her boyfriend.

None

The two-hour drive north passed peacefully and came to an end as they pulled up to the familiar hotel, Castaway Bay, and found a place to park in it's lot.

None

We're here, Puck smiled, turning off the engine, ready for a weekend together?

None

Rachel leaned over and pressed a kiss to his lips, definitely, she confirmed, before shifting and getting out of the car.

None

Puck smiled and followed her lead, grabbing his phone and climbing out to meet her at the trunk
None

Have you thought much about what you want to do while we're here?

None

Not really
None

I know there is quite a bit to do, she motioned around, but it's busier this weekend than it was before, so there will be more people here
None

I guess we can just go with the flow.

flow has no Synonyms in the API

Laughing lightly, Puck opened the trunk and pulled out his duffel bag, shouldering it and then grabbed her larger bag to carry, you do realize there's an indoor waterpark, right?

Yes, I do, which is why I chose that phrase, she replied with a grin, reaching for her smaller bag and threw it over her shoulder, along with her purse, I don't know if I want to use the waterpark, though
grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

It seems too crowded
None

For the reasons why we're here, it'd be difficult to be alone together, which is what we want.

None

Puck nodded in understanding as he closed the trunk and locked her doors, I get it
None

That's fine with me
None

We can always make a family trip up here sometime to play around in the park, but right now, it's not why we're here, he agreed, wrapping an arm around her shoulders as they walked towards the entrance.

None

Rachel smiled, glad they agreed and leaned her head against him while they walked, content and happy to be there
None

When they reached the doors, they pulled apart and Puck opened it for them and once they stepped into the tropical themed lobby, they went right over to the check-in counter to wait
None

Do you have your aunt's name tag? Rachel asked.

None

Yeah, Puck reached in his pocket and pulled it out, I don't know why it matters if they know who we are or not
None

Now they'll just make sure they're on their best behavior.

None

I think that's the point, Noah
None

She wants to make sure we don't have any problems while we're here, she replied while they waited.

None

We didn't last time, so I don't see why we would this time.

None

...

None

It only took a short time for the couple to get checked in and when Puck handed over his aunt's name tag, the woman at the counter took it and admitted they'd been expecting them, but nothing else was said about it
None

Once Puck signed for their room, they were given an information packet as well as their room keys and soon were waiting for the elevator to take them up to their floor.

None

Taking the elevator up to the top floor, Puck and Rachel followed signs for room numbers and finally came to a stop outside of the room
None

Using one of their key cards, Rachel opened the door and stepped inside first, flipping on the light as she went
door has no Synonyms in the API
None

Wow, she smiled, looking around, now I know what everyone meant by the upgrade.

None

Puck smiled as he saw the bathroom near the door, and off of it was a bedroom, along with a large living space with a couch, a table and chairs, a bigger TV, a small kitchen area and a door out onto the balcony, yeah, definitely
None

Gonna have to thank Bree for this, he agreed, closing the door and moving into the bedroom to set their bags down.

None

Following him, Rachel dropped her things by the others, we should call our parents to let them know we're here and check on Abby, she started, getting her camera, but first, she paused, taking his hand and guiding him out of the bedroom and over to the large glass door
None

Opening it, they stepped out onto the balcony, I want to take in the amazing view with you, she motioned towards the landscape of the water and the mostly cloudless sky.

None

Don't have to ask me twice, he grinned, wrapping his arms around her in a tight hug, you look gorgeous anywhere.

None

Rachel's cheeks began to flush as they hugged, thank you, Noah, and you're quite handsome yourself, she smiled, standing up a little taller to kiss him, I'm so glad we're here.

None

Returning her kiss, he replied, I'm really glad, too
None

We needed this and I look forward to when we can have more of these.

None

Really? She asked, looking at him curiously.

None

Yeah, definitely
None

I hope I get stationed somewhere on the East coast, so we're at least in the same time zone, but if not, wherever I am, I hope you'll visit, he explained, then we can have weekend getaways in other places.

None

I'd love that, because I'll visit as much as I can, she assured him.

None

Good
None

And I'll get home as often as I can, too
None

We'll have to talk about our visits, though
None

I don't think we'll be able to surprise each other, or we might pick the same weekend to visit and that would be awkward for me to get home and find out you're visiting me, he added with a laugh.

laugh has no Synonyms in the API
None

Oh wow! Rachel blushed, I've never thought of that, but you're right
None

I don't want that to happen, so I'll let you know when I want to visit.

None

Cool, he kissed her gently on the cheek.

None

Relaxing in his arms for a moment, Rachel figured out what she wanted to do that night and grinned at Puck, I'm gonna take a few pictures then I'm gonna go change
None

Could you call home?

None

Uh, yeah, sure
None

Why do you need to change? He asked, surprised at her words.

None

I just thought I'd get out of these jeans and into some shorts or a skirt or something, she shrugged.

None

Oh, alright, he nodded, taking her camera and turning it on, but I think we need a picture together first, he replied, holding it up and turning so their backs were to the water.

None

Rachel leaned against him, you just don't want me to be behind the camera all weekend.

None

Exactly, he smirked, kissing her and snapping a picture as soon as their lips touched.

None

...

None

As they pulled apart, Rachel's cheeks were red, but she couldn't complain at his reasoning, so they posed for a few pictures and then she took her camera back so he could go call their family.

None

Puck moved into the living area and took a seat on the small couch while Rachel snapped a few pictures outside and used his cell to call David's number, not sure if Alan would be at the house yet
picture has no Synonyms in the API
['use', ['picture'], 'to', 'call']

After two rings, he answered, hey David, Puck greeted.

None

Hey, Noah
None

Did you guys get there alright?

None

We did
None

Just got into our room a few minutes ago
None

Rachel's taking pictures, Puck grinned.

None

David laughed lightly, but chose not to say anything about it, hang on, he paused and after a moment he could hear talking in the background, so he knew David put him on speakerphone, we're over at your parents with Abby and Kona, David explained.

abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Alright, saves me a phone call, Puck smirked, hey!

None

Alan, Deborah and Ethan all greeted him, how was the trip up? Ethan asked.

None

It was fine, actually
None

Wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, but the hotel is, Puck explained, it was a little tough to leave Abby, but we got through it, he watched Rachel come inside, snapping a few pictures of the room as she did
None

Waving at him, she pointed to the phone and Puck took the hint, Rachel says 'hi'.

None

Tell her we say 'hi' back, Deborah chimed in, and don't worry about Abby
None

She'll be fine.

None

We know she will be, Puck assured them, noticing Rachel putting her camera down and going into the bedroom, so he knew she was going to change, but was surprised when she went into the bathroom with a small tote bag, I'm gonna let you guys go
bag has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'bag']

We're gonna figure out what we're gonna do tonight
None

Give Abby a hug and kiss for us and tell her we love her, please.

None

No problem, Noah
None

Have fun and we'll try not to call or text unless it's an emergency, David replied.

None

Puck smiled, thanks
None

I'm gonna turn our phones on silent, so if you do message us and we don't answer that's why.

None

Understandable
None

Talk to you later, Noah, Alan added.

None

Hanging up his phone, Puck did as he said and turned it on silent, and then went into the bedroom to find Rachel's
None

He found it on the dresser, so he turned the volume down on the ringer and noticed the bathroom had a door into the bedroom, which was closed, just like the one going into the living area
None

Now he was even more curious at what she was doing, which is the real reason he cut the conversation with their parents short, Rachel, is everything alright?

None

Of course it is, Noah
None

Why do you ask that? She called from the bathroom.

None

Because you're changing in the bathroom with the doors closed, he noted.

door has no Synonyms in the API
['change', 'with', 'door']

I'm fine, Noah
None

I'll be out in a few minutes, she replied simply.

None

Raising a curious eyebrow he gave in, alright
None

Well, do you want to go to dinner at the restaurant here or order something from room service?

None

Um, I'm not sure
None

Let me think on it, she answered.

None

Realizing he wasn't going to get anything from her until she came out of the bathroom, Puck grabbed their bags and moved them a little more out of the way and went to get the menu for room service from by the phone in the other room
None

Opening it up, he flipped through the few pages while he waited for Rachel and wondered what she was up to.

None

Hearing the bathroom door open, Puck turned, expecting Rachel to be coming towards him, but she wasn't in the room, so he knew she was in the bedroom
None

Before he could take a step, she appeared in the doorway and his eyes fell open in shock
None

She was not wearing what he expected; she was now dressed in a very revealing piece of lingerie
None

The top was noting more than a soft pink lace bra, showing off a lot more than her bras usually did
None

Attached to the bra was a see-through mesh in the same color, that wrapped around her toned abdomen and came to end at her hips, with a thin band of matching lace to tie the piece together
band has no Synonyms in the API
['end', 'with', 'band']

The matching lace panties, covered very little, and though he'd seen what was under them many times before, he rarely got to see her dress like that and his body quickly reacted to the sexy side of Rachel Berry she was showing him.

None

Rachel hoped his back would be turned when she came to stand in the doorway, but when she saw him facing her, she leaned against it and kept quite, watching his reaction
None

She expected his shocked expression, but the longer he remained silent, she began to worry it was too much, Noah? Don't you like it? She asked nervously.

None

Puck snapped from his trance at her words and shook his head, I don't like it
None

I love it! He assured her quickly, closing the distance between them to wrap his arms around her, and I hope you can feel just how much, he murmured against her neck.

None

Relaxing against him for a moment, she smiled and could feel exactly what he was talking about, I'm glad, she replied softly, pulling away to reach up and begin unbuttoning the shirt he hand on, because I was thinking we could really enjoy our evening and order room service later, she suggested, taking a step back and guiding him with her so they were moving further into the bedroom.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

I think that's a perfect idea, gorgeous, Puck replied with a grin, letting her take the lead.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

When Rachel had his shirt open, she pushed it off his shoulders and tugged at the t-shirt under it
None

Within moments, she had the item tossed to the floor with his other shirt, while Puck kicked his shoes off
shirt has no Synonyms in the API
['toss', 'with', 'shirt']

Before Rachel could reach for his belt, Puck wrapped his arms around her again and this time kissed her lovingly on the lips.

None

Rachel deepened the kiss and stood on her tiptoes, slipping her arms around his neck to hold him close.

None

With his arms around her waist, Puck guided her backward to the bed and with one hand reached for the blankets without breaking their kiss
hand has no Synonyms in the API
['reach', 'with', 'hand']

Pulling back the covers, he gently laid her down on the soft mattress and pulled away from her lips, I'm not gonna make you do all the work, he whispered with a smile, standing up to remove his jeans.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

I didn't mind, she admitted, kicking the blankets towards the foot of the bed, knowing they wouldn't need them, and settled comfortably against the pillows.

None

Free of his jeans, but leaving his boxers for the moment, Puck climbed onto the bed and found his girlfriend, figured we could take our time
None

I definitely don't want to rush.

None

Rachel smiled and reached up to pull him down for another kiss as he straddled her hips and got comfortable over her, I agree, she replied, taking in the view of his toned abs, as one hand gently traced along his soft skin.

None

You like that? He wondered, curiously, glancing down to watch her hand on his stomach.

None

I do, very much, she nodded, I've always thought you were very handsome, but those workouts you've been doing are working and I haven't been able to truly appreciate you.

None

He couldn't help a light blush grow on his cheeks, it's just a few workouts a week with dad, Finn and Uncle Ben to keep me in shape for boot camp, he murmured, but thanks
None

I know what you mean, too, he glanced over her body, I've always loved you and thought you were gorgeous, but it's been a long time since I've been able to really see how amazing you are.

None

Rachel rested her hands on his cheeks and smiled at him, thank you, Noah
None

It feels wonderful to hear you say that
None

To know that you'll always love me and think I'm pretty.

None

Puck leaned in and kissed her gently, and I'll tell you that every day for the rest of our lives, he promised, kissing away a tear that slipped from her eye.

None

Noah, let's make love, she smiled softly.

None

Shifting a little, Puck reached up and brushed some of hair from her eyes and returned her smile, I think that's a great idea.

None

...

None

The young couple easily moved into familiar territory, but took their time, unlike times in the past when they were worried about their daughter waking up or being interrupted by a phone call or visitor
None

This weekend was a rare time for them and they wanted to soak in and remember everything they could, because they knew once they returned home, life would return to normal, but also get busier as it got closer to graduation.

None

Neither wanted their moment to end, but both reached their peaks at the same time and slowly began to come down from their highs by settling against their pillows to relax in each others arms.

None

I gotta admit, this isn't how I expected our evening to start, but I loved it, Puck smiled, brushing some of Rachel's hair from her face.

None

I loved it, too, she replied softly, her eyes drifting closed in contentment.

None

Shifting slightly, Puck reached for the sheet and pulled it over them, your outfit is new.

None

Rachel nodded, yes, I got it the day the girls, Kurt and I went out to look for prom stuff.

None

And you've been hiding it for almost two weeks? He smirked, remembering the night she went out shopping.

None

I have been, she grinned, and I may have purchased a few more to add to the ones I already own.

None

Puck grinned, did you bring any more along?

None

Maybe, Rachel leaned in and kissed him, you'll have to wait and see, so no snooping in my bags.

None

Fine, he sighed, but you just look so good in them and I wish I could see you in them more often.

None

Rachel shifted closer and kissed him, all you have to do is ask, Noah, she murmured, you know I have others.

None

Yeah, but it just doesn't seem like something a guy should ask his girlfriend, he admitted.

None

Asking is different than telling, Noah, Rachel explained softly, telling me I have to wear them is definitely not something you would do, I know that, she added, but you could mention you'd like to see me dress up more often and then I could decide if I want to.

None

Puck nodded in understanding and smiled at her, then I'd like to see you dress up more.

None

I'll think about it, she winked.

None

Fair enough, he glanced at his watch, seeing it was a little after seven, sunset is around nine
None

Want to order something from room service and then go for a walk to watch the sun go down?

None

That sounds wonderful, she smiled, staying where she was, but do we have to move right now?

None

Puck smirked, no, we don't, but soon.

None

...

None

Slowly Puck and Rachel crawled out of bed and threw on some clothes and shoes before moving into the other room to look at the dinner menu
None

After making a few selections, Puck called in their order and found Rachel sitting on the balcony on one of the chairs
None

Kissing her cheek, he took a seat next to her and smiled, it's nice out here.

None

It is, Rachel agreed, it's a bit chilly, but not too bad
None

Though when it gets dark it will get cooler.

None

Well, at least if we go for a walk, we'll have more on than this, Puck motioned to her light robe and flip-flops.

None

There is that, she nodded, laughing lightly
None

Standing up, she stepped toward him and sat down on his lap, but I'm comfortable right now, she added wrapping her arms around his neck.

None

Puck smiled and snaked his arms around her waist, me too, babe
None

Unable to resist, he slid his hand under her thin robe and let his cooler fingertips rest on her warm skin, before slowly moving to brush over her soft breast.

None

Gasping lightly in surprise, but not flinching away, Rachel surprised herself when she leaned into his touch, causing a blush to grow on her cheeks
None

It wasn't the first time he'd touched her like that, but recently, she'd realized she enjoyed his touches there more and a shiver throughout her body added to her reaction.

None

Babe, what's wrong? He wondered softly, leaving his hand where it was, while trying to figure out what he did to cause the reaction he was getting.

None

I'm..
None

It's, she bit her lip, ducking her head in embarrassment, it's nothing.

None

Babe, it's something
None

Come on
None

You can tell me anything, he reminded her.

None

Taking a deep breath, she looked up, I like it when you do that
None

I..
None

I don't know how to explain it.

None

Letting his thumb brush over her sensitive flesh once more, he kissed her cheek, babe, it's normal
None

Everyone has places on their body that are more sensitive than others
None

I think, now that we're past the newness of being intimate, we're able to feel exactly where those places are
None

I know when we first began sleeping together, I felt sparks all over, even when you'd just kiss my neck
None

Now everywhere you touch, I feel sparks
None

I'm not saying our bodies are reacting less, I just mean that we're more in-tune to how our body feels and what we enjoy.

None

Really? You feel like that, too? But you have so much more experience than I do
None

I understand for me, since you're the only one I've slept with, but for you, I would think you'd already know that, she admitted softly.

None

Yes, I do have the experience of having sex with others, but I've never felt this way about anyone before, Rachel, he told her honestly, kissing her gently
other has no Synonyms in the API
None

You are the 

None

 person I've ever fallen for and the feelings I get with you are a thousand times stronger than anything I ever felt with some random person, he assured her, there is a difference
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
person has no Synonyms in the API
['feel', 'with', 'person']

Some might not believe it, but I do.

None

A single tear slipped from her eyes and she quickly wiped it away
None

She wasn't upset, just happy to hear what he said, that means a lot and now that you explain it, I believe it, too
None

And it's okay to feel like this? She motioned to where his hand was still resting.

None

It is, he smiled, I'm sorry we've never really had a 'sex talk' like that, but I believe enjoying this is a turn on for you, which is something I'm definitely going to remember.

None

Don't be sorry
None

We've both enjoyed our times together, so it really hasn't been necessary to bring up, she waved off his apology and continued, I think having just spent some wonderful time together, the thoughts and feelings were fresh in our minds and we could bring them up without being interrupted by family or friends, but thank you for telling me, she finished, wrapping her arms around him.

None

Puck gladly returned her hug and then leaned back in his seat, while she was still in his arms and then settled in for a few moments, you're welcome, babe
None

I'm always here to talk to.

None

...

None

Their late-evening dinner arrived a few minutes later and the couple reluctantly got up and moved inside
None

Rachel took a seat on the couch and Puck went to answer the door, since he had more clothes on than she did
None

Puck was greeted by one of the staff members and a small cart with their dinner items and after signing the check and tipping the person for bringing it up, he moved the cart into their room and over to the couch and coffee table.

None

Settling in to eat, the couple talked lightly over their meal and relaxed comfortably, loving the time together
None

They usually were with family or friends, so it was slightly difficult to have much alone time, but they loved being with everyone, so they did their best to get as much time alone as they could
family has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'family']

The time usually was right before they went to sleep at night, so the extra time they'd have during their weekend would be a big change, but they would take any time they could get.

None

Puck and Rachel briefly talked about what they wanted to do the next day and kept an eye on the time
None

They didn't want to miss the sunset and though Puck had suggested they take a walk around the resort to see it, but the more they thought about it, they decided to watch it that night from their balcony and they could be out somewhere the next night.

None

Since it was cooler now, Rachel put some warmer clothes on and the couple moved onto the balcony to watch the sunset
None

Rachel did take some pictures, but put it aside to just enjoy the moment with her boyfriend.

boyfriend has no Synonyms in the API
['enjoy', 'moment', 'with', 'boyfriend']

I think we should get up early for sunrise at six, Rachel said softly, leaning against her boyfriend as they stood by the railing.

None

Puck groaned, really? Can we go back to bed afterward? He wondered, draping one of his arms around her shoulders.

None

Rachel giggled lightly and slid an arm around his back, of course
None

I definitely wouldn't want to get up for sunrise and stay up, when we don't have to go to school or anything.

None

Alright, then I'm cool with that, he smiled, kissing her.

None

...

None

The couple watched the sun sink below the horizon and as the stars began to twinkle and the moon showed itself, they returned to their bedroom
None

They made love once more, before settling into the pillows and getting ready to go to sleep
None

They'd had an eventful day and even though they didn't want it to end, they also knew they had the weekend together and looked forward to being rested for it.

None

As the early morning alarm went off, the couple reluctantly got up and moved out to the balcony, bundled in warm clothes, to watch the sunrise
None

Both of them were half asleep and slightly groggy, but still enjoyed seeing the day begin.

None

This reminds me of seeing the sunrise in Seattle, Rachel said softly as she snuggled against him.

None

It does, he agreed, remembering their Nationals trip, the scenery is different, but the sky looks similar.

None

The reds, oranges and pink shades slowly appeared as the sun made it's presence known, lighting up the sky and the crisp May morning, we've come a long way since then.

None

Puck nodded, we have
None

Abby wasn't even born then and now she's almost thirteen months old
None

She's growing so fast.

None

She is, Rachel agreed, part of me wants time to slow down, so she doesn't grow anymore, but part of me is excited for when she's a little older and is talking and learning more
None

We'll be able to see more of her personality.

None

I hope she ends up being like you, he said honestly, gorgeous, smart, talented, supportive, loving, caring, honest, fun to be around
None

You're the whole package, babe.

None

Rachel's cheeks flushed at his compliment, thank you, Noah
None

That means a lot, that you want her to be like me
None

I'd like that, but I'd also like her to be like you, too
None

You're an amazing person, Noah
None

I know you had a rough childhood and are a 'badass', but it also made you strong, so I wouldn't mind if she is tough and strong like her dad
None

You also have a wonderful heart and are loving, caring and protective to the people you care the most about
None

Those are important traits, too.

None

Yeah, they are, he nodded in agreement, holding her close, then let's say that we hope she's the perfect balance between me and you, but no matter who she ends up like, we'll still love her the same.

None

Leaning up a little, she pressed a kiss to his lips, exactly!

None

...

None

Puck and Rachel returned to bed and relaxed, falling back to sleep for a few more hours, to wake up a little after ten and ordered brunch
None

While eating, they called to check on Abby and Kona and Rachel's dads admitted that both of them seemed confused that Puck and Rachel weren't around, but Abby hadn't gotten too fussy and Kona seemed to be okay
None

The young couple was glad things were alright at home and knew they'd be home the next day, so it wouldn't be long before they'd see them again.

None

After a short conversation with Rachel's dads, the couple put the phone away and got ready for their day
None

By noon, they ventured out for the first time since they'd arrived to wandered around the resort to check it out
None

The last time they'd been there, they hadn't gone out at all and this time they at least wanted to see what was there to do.

None

For the next several hours, Puck and Rachel walked around the grounds of the resort, taking pictures of the view, various things they saw along the way and shared the camera to get pictures of each other
None

They even stopped people and asked them to take their picture, so they could have some together that didn't involve one of them holding the camera
None

During their trip, sometimes they'd even stop and pass some time just sitting together on a bench, relaxing and enjoying the free time they had.

None

As the afternoon wore on, they moved into the hotel and over to their gift shop, picking up a few things for Dena and Abby, and even got something for Deborah
None

She insisted they didn't have to, but Puck and Rachel hadn't listened to Ethan when he said the same thing, and they weren't going to for Deborah either.

None

After making their purchases, they returned to their room to have a little 

None

, and Rachel showed him another piece of lingerie she'd brought along
None

He definitely loved seeing her in it and enjoyed taking it off as they made love, showing her just how much he loved it.

None

Relaxing for a while afterward and enjoying the quiet time, the couple soon got ready and ventured out for dinner at the restaurant in the resort
None

The took their time while eating, but they still had a while to go until sunset, so they went back to their room to continue their fun from earlier in the evening, which also gave them something to enjoy while waiting.

None

A little before sunset, the couple bundled up and headed out on the resort's grounds, to the bench they'd picked to watch the sunset from
None

Snuggled together while sitting, they relaxed, enjoyed the view and soaked in their last night away from home
None

They knew the next few weeks would be busy, and they wouldn't get a lot of 'alone' time, but they hoped they'd have as much as possible, whenever they could fit it in; they'd definitely try to get more.

None

When the sun disappeared beyond the horizon, the couple returned to their room for some bedtime activities, before getting to sleep, knowing they'd be driving back to Lima the next afternoon and would want to be well rested for the trip.

None

...

None

Monday morning, the couple skipped sunrise and slept in as late as they could, but knowing they had to check out by noon, they didn't get to stay in bed as long as they wanted
None

When they finally crawled out, while Rachel got showered, Puck began to pack, ordered room service and it arrived just as Rachel was finished in the bathroom
None

Sitting down to breakfast together, they also called Deborah to wish her a 'happy birthday' and promised they'd be home mid-afternoon, so they could join the family to take her out for dinner.

None

After a light conversation with them, the couple returned to packing and a little after eleven they were done, so Puck took their two large bags out to the car, so they didn't have to carry it down all in one trip
None

While he was gone, Rachel double checked their room and by the time he returned, she was sure they had everything
None

Since they had some time left, they spent it just standing on the balcony taking in the last few minutes of their trip, before gathering up the rest of their things and heading down to the lobby.

None

While they waited in line, Bree, who was working, came over to say 'hi' and talked with them while they were checking out
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

After returning their key cards and signing for their stay, Puck and Rachel were both surprised when they didn't have to pay anything; their parents were covering the entire trip.

None

Bree walked the teens out to Rachel's car and after talking for a short time, they shared hugs and Puck and Rachel began their journey back to Lima
None

Rachel called her dads briefly to let them know they were leaving and they were just putting Abby down for a nap, so she'd be asleep until they got home and they knew she'd be happy to see them when she woke up.

None

The drive back to Lima was uneventful, which the couple was happy about, because it meant it didn't take them extra time to get home
None

They missed Abby and everyone else, so even though they enjoyed the weekend away, they were looking forward to getting back home to their family.

None

...

None

Pulling into their driveway just after two-thirty, Rachel and Puck collected their bags and headed inside, finding David and Alan watching TV while Abby was napping
None

Kona met them excitedly at the door and after greeting her and Rachel's dads, the couple took some of their bags up to their room quietly, and stopped in the nursery to see if Abby was awake
None

She usually woke up around three, so they knew if she wasn't awake, she would be soon.

None

Abby was sitting up, staring at the door when Rachel pushed it opened, the sound having caught her attention and she smiled brightly as soon as she saw her mom and dad, mama! Dada! She said softly, reaching up for them.

None

Rachel moved right over and smiled, hey there baby girl, she carefully picked her up and kissed her cheek, did you miss us?

None

Wrapping her little arms around Rachel's neck as best she could, Abby relaxed for a moment and then looked at Puck, reaching for him.

None

Hey kiddo, Puck smiled, stepping closer and kissing her cheek, while she grabbed onto one of his fingers, mom and I had fun, but we missed you, he said honestly.

None

Yes we did, Rachel agreed, maybe next time we go on a trip you can come with us, she added looking at her boyfriend.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck nodded at her idea, yeah, I think that's something we could definitely do, he leaned in and pressed a kiss to Rachel's lips and Abby's forehead, because I can't wait to start taking family vacations.

None

...

None

Abby was very happy Puck and Rachel were home, but it really wasn't put into perspective until after they'd gone downstairs with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck had taken the rest of their bags upstairs and Rachel tried to put Abby down in her play pen, but she cried and reached for Rachel
None

At first, Rachel thought she hurt her or one of her fingernails accidentally scratched her, so she quickly picked her up and she calmed right down.

None

What's wrong sweetie? Are you hurt? Rachel asked softly, rubbing her back and looking at her arms and legs to see if anything was wrong.

None

Puck was just coming back downstairs and had heard her crying, she's fine, babe
None

She just doesn't want you to put her down.

None

Glancing at him, Rachel turned her gaze to Abby, seeing how she was snuggling up to her, her small first holding onto Rachel's shirt, really?

None

Yeah, he nodded, moving closer, see how she calmed down as soon as you picked her up? At Rachel's nod, he continued, she missed us
None

She's used to us coming back in a few hours after school, but this time we didn't
None

Eventually she'll realize we'll always come home, but she's still learning all that.

None

Rachel let what Puck said settle in her mind as she held Abby, is that why you're upset? You wanna be close to us, sweetheart? Rachel pressed a kiss to Abby's forehead, we're right here
None

We just went away for the weekend, but we're here now, she spoke softly, rubbing her back as she rocked back and forth a little on her feet to calm Abby down.

None

Puck smiled at them and took a deep breath, yeah, and even if we do go away, we'll always come back to you, he promised, brushing his index finger over her cheek, I'm going away soon, but I'll be back when I can, he added, wrapping his arms around Rachel's waist and kissing her cheek, so no need to cry.

None

Smiling up at him, Rachel kissed him gently, there's nothing wrong with crying for a little while
None

I know I'll cry when you leave, but I'll calm down, because I know you'll be home later, she told him honestly, but I do understand what you mean with Abby

None

She doesn't get all that yet, so it will be different for her, until she understands more.

None

Standing with an arm around Rachel's waist, he rested a comforting hand on Abby's back, joining Rachel's, exactly.

With Puck and Rachel easily setting in at home, David and Alan went back to their place to change for the evening
None

While they're gone, Puck and Rachel got Abby ready and then they, along with Kona headed across the street to the other Puckerman's home to see them and hang out for a while.

None

It wasn't long before the Puckerman and Berry family was heading out to dinner, in celebration of Deborah's official birthday that day, which happened to fall on Memorial Day, the reason why the kids were out of school
None

Puck and Rachel admitted they were really happy for the three-day weekend and thanked their parents, again, for their weekend getaway
None

It was definitely a trip they needed and really enjoyed the time away.

None

With conversations about their trip, the weekend, the party and plans for the upcoming weeks, the night got later and the family soon paid their bill and headed home
None

While standing outside of Puck and Rachel's, they shared hugs and said 'goodnight', so everyone could get home and take care of things before returning their schedules the next day.

None

Puck and Rachel easily got Abby bathed and changed into her pajamas, though when Rachel tried to lay her down in the crib, she clung to Rachel and got fussy again, just like she'd done earlier that day, it's alright sweetheart, Rachel murmured, holding her close and kissing her cheek, we're right here
None

Maybe daddy could sing your 'ray-bo' song
None

That might help and he hasn't done that since your birthday, she said softly, glancing at Puck.

None

Ray-bo? She's got you saying it? Puck smirked.

None

Well, she can't say 'rainbow' yet, but she's trying
None

I thought she'd recognize it if I said it her way
None

Will you? She asked hopeful.

None

Yeah, I will, he nodded, moving out of the room and returning a few moments later with his guitar.

guitar has no Synonyms in the API
['return', 'with', 'guitar']

The song they were referring to was 'Over The Rainbow'
None

The mobile above Abby's crib played it, but it wasn't the original version from 'The Wizard Of Oz'
None

This version was the ukulele version made famous by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole
None

After Puck and Rachel realized she liked the song and it settled her down to sleep, Puck found the guitar sheet music online and learned it for her
None

In the past few months he'd played it a few times, but he usually only did it as a special treat
None

She loved it and it usually put her to sleep, but sometimes she'd stay awake through the whole thing and Rachel would help her clap when he finished.

None

This time, Puck expected her to fall asleep and once Rachel had settled into the rocking chair with Abby, Puck began playing the song he'd memorized
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

Abby immediately recognized it and watched him with bright smile on her face as she settled against Rachel's chest, 

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None



None

Puck smiled at his girlfriend and daughter as he played along, the notes easily familiar to him and he even added some additional runs on the guitar to add something original to it
None

He could tell that Abby was slowly drifting to sleep, but he knew if he stopped she would wake up, so he continued on, 

None



None

By the time Puck finished that verse, Abby was sound asleep in Rachel's arms, but he continued to play and finished the song
None

Rachel smiled at him and he set aside his guitar to help her stand without jostling Abby too much and they carefully laid Abby down in her crib without waking her up, and then turned on the mobile so she could hear the song again
None

Puck wrapped his arm around Rachel's shoulders and kissed her forehead as they watched her sleep for a few moments, before carefully stepping out of the room and closing the door behind them.

None

Standing in the hallway, Rachel wrapped her arms around her boyfriend, Noah, I love you singing that song.

None

Thanks, he smiled, returning her hug and kissing her lips, you can always join me, if you want.

None

I know, but I'd rather listen, she blushed, and it feels more like your song for her.

None

Babe, I don't lay any claim to it, he told her honestly, it can be our song we sing to her.

None

Really? Rachel smiled, contemplating his suggestion, I don't know if she'd like me singing it with you.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I don't see why she wouldn't
None

She likes your voice and likes the song, so why not? He asked, guiding her into their room.

None

When you put it that way, you're right, she agreed, I guess I was thinking I should have my own song to sing to her, because it won't be as special if we both sing the same one.

None

Yeah, I get what you mean, but it's how often we do it that makes it special
None

If we both sing it for her once and a while, she'll still get excited for it.

None

That is true, Rachel nodded, I'll try it out soon and see if she likes it
None

Maybe you could still play the guitar?

None

Yeah, I can do that, he agreed, deciding he should tell her why he hasn't played it much, the reason why I don't play it too often is because I don't want her to get in the habit of needing it every night, he took a deep breath, I leave in a few weeks and I'd hate for her to be difficult because I'm not here to play it, he paused, I was actually going to ask you if your cameras recorded sound with a video so you could record me playing it.

video has no Synonyms in the API
['record', 'sound', 'with', 'video']

Rachel smiled and nodded in understanding, yes, my cameras do, and I don't know if you remember those daily videos I used to make of me singing, but I still have that recording software.

None

Oh, I totally forgot about that, he blushed a little, but smiled, that'd be awesome if we could come up with something
something has no Synonyms in the API
None

Maybe even record a few versions, so you don't have to play her the same one every time, he suggested, we definitely have to do this before I leave.

None

Rachel stood up on her tip toes and kissed him as her arms wrapped around his waist, we will, she promised, and if we're going to do that, could I make a request?

None

Uh, sure, he nodded, unsure what she was getting at.

None

Could you record 'Sweet Caroline' for me? She asked softly, having thought about asking him and this conversation was the perfect time to bring it up.

None

Puck smiled and wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close, baby, I'd be happy to record that for you and any other song you'd like, he told her honestly.

None

Thank you, Rachel smiled, hugging him, I've been wanting to ask you, but I wasn't sure how to bring it up
None

This conversation was the perfect time.

None

It was, he agreed, we can talk details later, but yeah, I'm definitely up for recording some songs.

None

That's wonderful
None

I'll figure out the songs and we can maybe set aside some evenings coming up to do that, she suggested.

Puck nodded, sounds good to me.

I've already planned out the last chapters, or at least a general idea of what I plan to do in each one.

A/N5: My dad and mom's medical issues flared up in late-February

Dad ended up having his left foot amputated in mid-March, so he was in the hospital and then a rehab center for about a month total, so we were dealing with a lot of things with him

He's doing alright and got home in early-April
None

Then about 2 weeks later, my mom had to be rushed to the ER for abdominal pain and a ton of other things
None

They couldn't figure out what was causing the pain, exactly, so she was admitted and 2 days later had exploratory surgery to find out what was wrong
None

We knew she had a cancerous mass in her pelvis (her cancer from a few years ago is back), which was putting pressure on some of her organs, so they had to take out some of the mass and she had an abscess that ruptured, so it gave her sepsis, after surgery she was in the ICU for 8 days, she had a lot of problems and we almost lost her, but with prayers and love, she thankfully pulled through

After a few more days in the hospital (in a regular room), she was released to a rehab center and just got home 3 days ago, spending a month away from home

As you can see I have a lot going on, but I'm still trying to write when I can and hopefully I'll be able to get some more updates out soon

In this story, of the Glee songs used, I've stayed with songs from season 1, but after other songs I used showed up in later seasons of Glee, (for example 'Umbrella' by Rihanna was written into this story in early 2010 (season 1) and at the end of 2010, in '2x07 - The Substitute', the song was a mash-up with 'Singing In The Rain')

My Puckleberry WIPs are still top priorities, but I have some ideas that I need to get down when I have some time to write..
None

I could go through a long explanation, but all I'll say now is that one of my ideas involves my favorite couple on Blue Bloods, Danny and Linda, who I've dubbed Lindy
None

Amy Carlson who plays Linda has retweeted a tweet I wrote about Lindy! She also follows me on Twitter and so does Donnie Wahlberg who plays Danny! So cool! Anyway, in one of my ideas, Danny and Linda meet a version of Ethan and Deborah
None

These two couples relate so much (and it was never planned on my part! Deborah has been a nurse for years and it was long before Linda ever went back to work as a nurse in Blue Bloods! And Ethan is a different type of cop than Danny is, but it's still a cop/nurse relationship) and I want to integrate some of my favorite original characters into my Blue Bloods fic, as a more comfortable way for me to expand my writing into another fandom..
None

And I'm sure you'll see a version of Arin, Puck, Rachel and Abby in NYC with Deborah and Ethan, too!

A/N5: To the anonymous reviewer who recently commented they hoped I didn't let Puck go into the Navy without him and Rachel getting married, because he'd have to relinquish all custody to Rachel, etc., I know..
None

I have known for a long time that was how the military works for single parents (they have to turn over complete custody of their child(ren) to their grandparent, other parent, sibling, or friend, etc.), but as I was talking with my Navy friend, we agreed even though that is true, I could take some author liberties with that and I chose not to discuss too much about the exact details of what Puck 'has to do' when it comes to Abby and him joining the military as an unmarried parent
friend has no Synonyms in the API

I know it was discussed briefly, but I wanted it to mostly be clear that Abby was taken care of legally and the 'details' didn't need to be described down to the last detail..

And Puck and Rachel are not going to be unmarried for long, I promise
None

Thank you for your concern and for the input

It means the world to me that people continue to read this story and care enough about it to tell me things like this

For the next three days at school, New Directions traveled to the three middle schools that sent McKinley new Freshmen, just like they'd done the year before
None

Each day was a new school, and they alternated a morning or afternoon performance so they Glee club members didn't miss the same classes all week and at each school, they invited the soon-to-be Freshman to join or at least come to check out the club the following year
None

They hoped to get a few new members, because with the Seniors graduating, they were losing several people and they didn't want to be too close to the minimum for competitions, like they once had been.

Like the year before, the teens wore jeans and their converse, but instead of just a simple t-shirt, they wore special ones

After they won at Nationals, Will ordered t-shirts for all the directors and teens

The shirts were red, with 'WMHS New Directions - 2010-2011 National Show Choir Champions' on the front and on the back was their name

They hadn't talked about doing a shirt, but when they arrived in early May, the teens were exited and knew these concerts were the perfect time wear them.

Ben, Will and Emma had traveled to all three schools on the bus with the club, and Ethan and Deborah met them there, wanting to have all the directors there

During the performances, they explained why they were there and Will invited anyone interested in joining to come up to the stage afterward, to talk to him, the other directors and members
None

They didn't expect many to come up to them, but after each school, they left with a list of at least five students interested, which was a good thing, but the returning members began to worry there would be too many members, so they knew they had a lot of decisions to make in the near future.

One of them would be added to their Friday evening concert at McKinley for friends, family and the public, and the other would be for graduation
None

The song ideas originally hit Rachel on Tuesday afternoon and after talking privately with Puck about it, the couple went to the music store that night to get the sheet music for each song, though both were songs at least some of the club would know.

Rachel and Puck called a secret Glee meeting during lunch time on Wednesday, so their directors that were at McKinley wouldn't find out, and presented their ideas to the club
None

Like Puck, everyone loved Rachel's ideas and decided to keep it a secret from their directors until their performances and agreed to meet after school and during lunches, so they'd have time get the songs down
None

For the time being, they also decided to focus on the one for Friday night and spent the rest of their lunch practicing the vocals for it.

None

Wednesday after lunch, the teens headed to another middle school, and everyone kept quiet about their after school practice
None

Rachel and Puck had already talked to Susan about watching Abby a little longer that day and the next, so they could practice and she was alright with it.

After another successful concert, the teens returned to McKinley and got back to work on the song
None

They decided they wanted to focus more on the words and their voices, so they kept the choreography simple, worked on their timing and made sure they were hitting the right notes as they sang
None

The club worked until they usually finished Glee practices and were close to having the first song down, so agreed to meet the next day during lunch.

None

Thursday morning the club went to the last middle school and after getting back to McKinley, they spent their lunch practicing the new song, making sure they had it down and were comfortable with how it was turning out
None

By the end of lunch, they were confident they had it down and Glee met like usual after school and all their directors tried to get them to say what they'd been doing, but no one was talking
None

The only thing Rachel said was she promised they'd find out soon.

None

Friday afternoon, New Directions was performing in front of McKinley, as winners and not as the 'losers' they'd been treated like the year before
None

They'd finally made it to the top and won Nationals, bringing a title to the school that hadn't been seen since the 90s
None

Yes, McKinley had the Cheerios, who held numerous first place titles, but the school needed more recognition than just a successful cheer team and New Directions gave it to them.

None

At the beginning of their performance, the students clapped, more to be polite than anything
None

The further they got along in their songs, the more the McKinley student body, and the teachers began to cheer and follow along with some of the more popular songs the club was singing.

some has no Synonyms in the API
None

The club was ending their concert with the three songs they'd done for Nationals
song has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck and Rachel sang the ballad, 'Faithfully' and while the guys were dancing to 'The Boys Are Back', Puck could see everyone was into the music and the dance steps, which gave him an idea
None

When they finished the song and went backstage to regroup before their final performance and Will spoke briefly to the students, asking for new members, Puck caught everyone's attention, I have an idea.

None

What's that, Noah? Rachel asked.

None

I think we should do the song we've been working on
None

I know this is the time we were going to do it tonight, but I think we should do it today
None

All our directors are here, he motioned to where his parents, Ben and Will were sitting, and it's 'We Are The Champions'
None

It could be the biggest slap in the face to anyone who wants to still bully you guys next year
None

None of us are losers, we never have been and it's time to show it to them, he admitted, looking at Rachel and the others who weren't graduating.

None

Let's do it, Rachel grinned, nodding at him, I know we talked about doing it right before our last one, 'You're My Number One', but I think it should be our last one, she explained.

None

The teens shared looks and nodded in agreement, and with everyone's decision made, they moved out on stage to begin their last song from Nationals, 'You're My Number One'
decision has no Synonyms in the API

Going through it just like at Nationals, as Rachel and Quinn sang the last lines together and bowed when the school began to cheer for them, thinking it was their last song.

None

Will, stood up and began to make his way towards the stage, but Puck stopped him, hang on Mr
None

Schue
None

We have one more song, he admitted and at Will's confused look, Puck smiled, we've been working on something for the last few days that we want to share with you all, he said looking at the school, this song is very important to us
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's been an emotional two years for us, as a club and as friends, and now we can sing this next song, because we made it
None

It took two years, but we did it
None

We'd really like to thank our directors for helping us get where we are and though myself and a few others won't return next year, we know we've been a part of something amazing and we wouldn't trade the time for anything else, he took his place on the far corner of the edge of the stage and nodded at the band to begin playing, please enjoy, he smiled, taking a deep breath and starting with his solo,

 Puck added the end of the chorus.

 she bowed to the audience,

 she waved and bowed again.

The two groups of teens on the edge of the stage slowly moved towards the center, so they were all together, with arms around the backs or shoulders of the person next to them, as Quinn and Finn continued the chorus together,

Behind them, all the other club members were standing in a similar way on the first step of the risers, arms around the backs or shoulders of the ones next to them, but as they continued with the the chorus, singing,

 they walked off the risers towards the line of their friends on the edge, standing just behind them.

Rachel and Quinn shared the next line,

After Rachel and Puck sang, 

None

 to end the chorus, everyone sang, 

None

 Ending the song and bowing to their audience, who erupted in loud cheering and clapping, some even whistling and rooting for them.

None

For the next few moments, the teens shuffled on stage
None

At first, the six Seniors stepped forward, waving and bowing to the school
None

The original members then stepped to the front, to show where they'd really started
None

The Seniors then all stepped away, allowing the members who'd be returning the following school year to take a place on the edge, and during the whole time, the school continued to cheer and clap for them.

None

It was a very defining moment for the club
None

During the previous year, many had been bullied and teased, and after taking second at Nationals, most of that stopped, so the newest members didn't get a real taste of what the school had done
None

Now, they were being celebrated and they realized they were even further up on the social 'food chain' at school than they had been and that the school liked them
None

They'd gotten a brief look at the school's change when they returned as winners at Nationals, but it wasn't until that moment that the club could see how much had changed in just two school years.

None

The Seniors were a mix of emotions
None

They were so happy to have been a part of the rebuilding process for the club and were glad to have been there to win Nationals, so they were leaving on a high note, but they were also sad to be graduating and it hadn't really hit them until the end of the song
None

Quinn was the one to mention they were graduating in eight days and they only had two more performances left, as members of New Directions and as high school students, which hit everyone hard and though Quinn was the only one of them to shed tears, all the guys felt the same way she did.

None

While the six soon-to-be graduates stood off to the side of the stage and talked, sharing an emotional moment, Puck spoke up to calm them down, officially, we're leaving the club in good hands, but just because we're getting our diploma in a week and we won't be able to perform with them for competitions, doesn't mean we're walking away completely
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

We'll all still be involved, just not exactly the same way we have been for the past few years.

None

Puck's right
None

We'll still be here, just not as students, Finn agreed.

None

Yeah, that's true
None

I guess it all just hit me
None

We've all talked about 'when we graduate', but I just hadn't realized how close it really was, Quinn admitted.

None

Seems like the year's flown by, Mike added, so I understand.

None

It has, but it's not over yet, Puck smiled, hugging Rachel when she skipped over them, hey babe.

None

Noah, that was a great idea! She kissed him excitedly.

None

Well, you're the one who came up with the song in the first place, so same to you, he replied with a wink.

That was amazing, everyone! Will commented happily, as he, Ben, Deborah and Ethan came up onto the stage, while the students filed out, this was the song you've been working on in secret?

None

Puck nodded, yeah
None

Rachel came up with the idea earlier this week and we thought we'd surprise you guys tonight, but I suggested just before we did our last song from Nationals that we should do it today, too.

We're glad you liked it, Rachel smiled.

None

We definitely did, Deborah nodded, hugging Rachel and Puck.

None

Will looked around at the the teens, I'm so proud of you all
None

We've come so far in these two years and we're going to miss the Seniors, but you'll always be a part of the club
None

I don't think we can ever top number one in the nation, but I do see continued success in the future for New Directions.

None

Well said, Mr
None

Schuester, Rachel smiled.

None

Puck nodded in agreement and held out his hand to the center of the group they were standing in, New Directions on three, okay? He asked, glancing around as everyone was quickly putting their hands on top of his in the middle, one..
None

two..
None

three...

None

New Directions! They shouted, clapping and cheering
None

They knew things would be changing in the next few weeks, but the friendships and relationships formed over the past two years would never end; they'd only grow stronger with time, so they settled to focus on that and not dwell on the coming changes.

The evening concert at McKinley was just as successful, exciting and emotional as the afternoon one had been
None

The auditorium was a packed house, most being close friends and family members of the Glee teens, but a lot of the attendees were teens and their friends or parents who had gone to the McKinley or middle school concerts and wanted to see them perform again
None

Rachel and Puck were glad to have Abby in the audience and waved at her several times when they saw her pointing to them on the stage
None

She was sitting on David or Alan's lap, Deborah and Ethan had Dena and Arin with them and sitting nearby was David's sister and Anna, Rachel's cousin who looked a lot like Rachel, and most of Puck's cousins around his age from Northern Ohio and his grandma were also there.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

All of the other Glee members had a some family there and the teens were happy to see the large turn-out
None

It meant that people came to see them on their own and didn't have to, just because it was a school event
None

The club also knew they could get donations to help pay for costumes, sheet music and travel expenses for the next day
None

They were getting funds from the school and the school district and had gotten a nice amount of money for them winning Nationals, but the next year they had three competitions, all with at least a night stay in a hotel, and even though the show choir board got deals for the clubs, the money they had would not get them through all three competitions, so they would continue to fund raise whenever they could.

None

Their concert lasted a little over two hours, with the final song being 'We Are The Champions'
None

They had added a few more songs to their set list and for their groups of songs from each competition, they changed into one of their costumes from it, so their evening ended in them dressed up in their Nationals costume
None

When they finished their final song and had done their introductions like they had that afternoon, the teens headed backstage to change while the audience began to leave, dropping donations off in several boxes set up for them.

None

Changing back into their regular clothes, the teens began leaving to go meet with family and Puck and Rachel were following, because they wanted to meet with their out-of-town family before they left
family has no Synonyms in the API
['meet', 'with', 'family']

It was nice to see them and they wanted to hang out longer, but because it was late and they had a several hour trip home, they didn't stay long.

None

Calling it an early night, the Lima residents shared hugs and said 'goodnight', before parting, Rachel and Puck got Abby's car seat from her dads' car and soon the small family was home, getting ready for bed.

None

...

None

Saturday morning began much like their weekends usually did, but it was later than usual
None

Abby had been up a lot later than she usually was, because of the concert, so she slept in longer
None

This gave Rachel and Puck a chance to get a few extra hours of sleep, something they'd need because they'd be up late that night for Puck's Senior Prom.

None

It was a little before ten when the couple finally rolled out of bed and shared taking care of Abby and Kona and then the couple, with Abby in her highchair, sat down to have brunch

Is there anything you'd like to do today? Puck asked curiously.

None

Aren't we going to your prom? She replied, looking at him.

None

Puck laughed lightly, well, yeah, there is that, but that's tonight
None

We still have all afternoon
None

I, um, kinda have plans for Sunday, he admitted.

None

You do? She paused, trying to remember if he'd said something about that day, is it recruiter or Navy stuff?

None

No, he shook his head, just taking Arin out for the day, but she doesn't know it yet, but mom and dad, do
None

Hannah will be staying there tonight, so Uncle Ben and Aunt Susan can be chaperones at the dance tonight and because Jessica is going out with TJ, but Hannah will be going home before noon, so I'm gonna take Arin out for lunch and then go do something afterward.

Rachel smiled, that sounds like a great idea, Noah

I remember you said you wanted to do that before you left
None

I'm sure she'll love the time with you.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I hope so, Puck nodded, I hadn't expected to wait this close to leaving to get to it, but the point that I'm doing it in the first place is the important part, right?

None

Exactly, Rachel agreed, and we've all been busy, so it's understandable it hasn't come up yet
None

She has spent time with you, too, but it hasn't been one-on-one like this will be
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm sure she'll enjoy hanging out and love the fact you care enough to want to take her out
None

You also have plenty of time to go out again, too, because after you graduate, you'll have just under two weeks before you leave.

None

Puck smiled at what she said, you're right
None

I do still have plenty of time, he reached over with a wash cloth to wipe some crumbs off Abby's cheeks, making her giggle and bat it away, with all of you.

You do, she returned his smile and jumped when her phone began to ring next to her, sorry.

None

No worries
None

Who is it?

None

It's Quinn, she hit the answer button, hey Quinn! She greeted.

None

Hey Rachel, hope I'm not interrupting anything, the blond admitted.

None

No, well, we're just having a late breakfast, but I can talk
None

What's up? She wondered, knowing they'd see each other in a few hours.

None

I actually need some advice, Quinn replied, it's about my mom.

None

Okay, what's going on? Rachel asked, now concerned, is everything alright?

None

Yeah, I guess
None

I don't know
None

You know how my mom went to the concert last night? Quinn asked and Rachel said 'yes', she continued, well, after you guys left last night, she mentioned that she saw signs for prom in the halls at school, including the posters of me and Finn for king and queen
None

Now she's all excited, because I hadn't told her and she, my sister and several of my mom's relatives have been either king or queen at their prom, so she's all excited and wants me to go over to her house to get ready, the blond sighed, Finn thinks it's a great idea, because he wants to 'pick me up for prom'
None

I don't want to go, because I know she's gonna make a big deal out of it and I just want to go tonight and enjoy myself
None

Is that too much to ask?

None

No, it isn't, Rachel said honestly, what did you tell her when she brought it up?

None

I told her I'd think about it
None

Yes, I could win, but I didn't want her to know I was nominated, which is why I never told her
None

I didn't want her to get involved like she did with my sister; she had my sister doing all these stupid things, like telling her she had to beg for votes, because she had to continue on the family tradition, Quinn was beginning to sound a bit frustrated, but Rachel let her continue, well, screw that
sister has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'sister']

I want people to vote for me, because they like me or think I deserve it
None

I definitely don't want to win just to continue on one of her stupid family traditions.

None

That is quite understandable, Quinn
None

I know you and your mom are still rebuilding your relationship and it sounds like she was quite pushy with your sister so she'd win and if I were you, I wouldn't want to be involved in that either, Rachel agreed, I'll be honest, I could see the Quinn who first joined Glee going along with your mom, but you're not that person anymore
mom has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'mom']

You haven't been that way for a very long time; you're more mature now, you're very likeable and I'm proud to call you my sister
None

I definitely think you'll win tonight, and it will be because of the person you are now.

None

Thanks, Rachel
None

That really means a lot, Quinn took a deep breath, so, should I just tell my mom I'm not going to her place or what?

None

Maybe you could invite her over to your place
None

That way, if she's around others, she'll be less inclined to bring up family traditions, Rachel suggested, getting an idea, she can still see you before we go and you won't have to go over to her house.

None

That could work, but it's gonna be crowded here, because Ryan is coming over around four with his mom and then Kurt and Finn are here with Burt and Carole.

mom has no Synonyms in the API
['come', 'with', 'mom']

As Quinn spoke, Rachel's idea took more shape, but wanted to ask Puck first, there is that
None

Hang on a second, Rachel pressed the mute button, so Quinn couldn't hear what she was saying and then looked at Puck, Noah, would you be alright with Quinn coming over here to get ready for prom and invited her mom, too?

None

Puck thought for a moment and shrugged, Judy has kept her distance and it might be good for her to see the nice home Abby is living in, so if she did still have any doubts about what Quinn did, it might ease her mind.

None

I get what you mean
None

That's why I wanted to ask, she nodded, I remember everything that came up in December when Judy showed up at Sectionals and then when she came up to the Hudson's to see Quinn and meet everyone
None

Aside from a brief few moments last night, she hasn't seen Abby since December, and she's never been in our house before
None

I know I was nervous about her finding out about Abby and the fear is still in the back of my mind, but it's not as strong anymore
None

Like you said, she's kept her distance and and I think this would be a good next step
None

She's not related to us and Quinn only sees her a few times a month, so she has no need to ever be here, but tonight we're all getting ready for prom
None

If Quinn gets ready here, I think her mom should be here, and our parents will be over, too, so she won't be alone with us.

None

Yeah, you're right, he nodded in understanding, Judy has no need to be here, but tonight is different and if you're alright with her coming over for a bit, then I'm cool with it, too, he replied.

None

Great! Rachel took her phone off mute, Quinn are you still there?

None

Yeah, I am, Quinn responded.

None

I have an idea to help fix your problem, Rachel replied.

None

You do? Quinn wondered, this is why I called you, actually
None

I knew you'd come up with something or at least have some good advice.

something has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel smiled at the compliment, I'm happy to help, you know that
None

My idea is you getting ready over here and having your mom stop by
None

That way Finn can pick you up like he wants, you can be here where it won't be as crowded with guys getting ready and you won't have to go to your mom's, but your mom could still see you, Rachel suggested, finishing up her last few bites of breakfast.

None

Are you sure? Did you ask Puck about that? Quinn replied, thinking of taking her up on the offer, but wanting to make sure Puck knew about it.

None

Rachel blushed, that's why I put you on 'mute'
None

I asked him and he's cool with it
None

So am I
None

Besides, it'll be fun to get ready together
None

I don't know why it never came up before.

None

I don't know, either, but it's a great idea
None

Thanks, Rachel and thank Puck for me, too, Quinn replied.

None

I will, Rachel smiled, I know our reservations are at five-thirty, so Noah and I are going to get ready around four-thirty
None

We want to make sure we don't spill anything or get dog hair on our clothes, she explained, so if you'd like to come over, say around four, that would work.

None

Okay, sounds good
None

I'll gather my things up and be over after I take a shower, Quinn admitted, I guess I should go call my mom and tell her
None

Thanks again, Rachel.

None

No problem
None

See you in a few hours, Rachel replied honestly.

None

See you then, Quinn finished, ending the call.

None

Rachel set her phone down on the table, she'll be over later
None

I kinda feel weird going to prom, too, she commented.

None

Why? Puck asked, having finished breakfast and was working on cleaning up Abby while she'd been on the phone.

None

Because I'm not a Senior and they've been clear since the committee posted signs for prom that it was a Senior thing
None

I know underclassmen can go as a Senior's date, which is why I can go with you and Seniors can also bring a date that graduated last year, because not all couples are in the same grade, like us, so you can go with me next year, but this year just a few of us from Glee are going

Jessica and TJ aren't going, in fact, the only Glee members who are going, who are not Seniors, are Brittany, Mercedes, me and Kurt
None

I think I'm used to doing the dancing and partying with everyone, so it's a bit different to not have everyone there, Rachel explained, I haven't paid much attention to the reasons, but do you know why it's only for Seniors? I think I know the reason, but I don't know if it's true.

Puck lifted Abby out of her high chair and kissed her cheek, setting her against his chest, prom used to be for all school students, but only Seniors could be nominated for king and queen
None

The school has Homecoming and other dances throughout the year and I guess about ten years ago the Seniors began to complain about the dances being so crowded and by letting all the grades attend, it was taking away from the Seniors enjoying their last formal dance as high school students and with their fellow Seniors, he told her as the two moved into the living room and he set Abby in her playpen, and then he and Rachel took seats on the couch, the year before I started at McKinley the prom committee finally took the hint and they and Figgins agreed to cut out the other three grades from coming and turned it into a Senior Prom
senior has no Synonyms in the API
['enjoy', 'dance', 'with', 'senior']

When those rules were announced, Seniors were pissed because not everyone dated someone in the same grade, so they changed them to allow the Seniors to bring a date, as long as they were either a student at McKinley or someone who'd graduated the year previous; the same rules we have now
None

Since then, the rules have stuck and I'm kinda glad they have, he admitted.

None

Rachel listened to what Puck told her and nodded in understanding, that's why I thought it was now just for Seniors and their dates
None

It makes sense and I like it, too
None

It makes this dance more intimate because there won't be as many people there.

None

Exactly, he smiled, draping his arm around her shoulders and pulling her close, I get to hang out with some of my best friends and my amazing girlfriend

None

That's all I care about.

None

It will be a great night, Rachel agreed, snuggling up to him, but I still think you should have done something for Prom King
None

You are nominated.

None

I don't care about that and Finn and Quinn are nominated for king and queen, so there's a pretty good chance they'll win; they're like stereotypical prom royalty, Puck replied with a smirk, besides, there's only one queen I'd ever want and she's in my arms right now, he added looking at her.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API

Rachel smiled brightly and returned his gaze as she moved one of her hands to rest it against his cheek, I'll always be your queen, Noah and you're my only king.

With a later start to their day, and knowing they had a big night ahead of them, Puck and Rachel were content to hang out at home, relaxing for the afternoon
None

Quinn let Rachel know that Judy had agreed to the plans and they'd be over sometime after four, so Puck and Rachel let their parents know, so they weren't surprised at her arrival and messaged them a little bit, while she and Puck watched TV and Kona watched Abby play with some toys in her play pen.

None

After a short time, Rachel laid a soft blanket on the floor of the living room and let Abby out of her play pen, so she could walk around and Puck and Rachel took seats on either side of the blanket, to keep an eye on her
None

Abby got one of her stuffed balls out and the three of them tossed it back and forth, letting her try to catch it and then she'd go closer to either of them and toss it to them, you know, we might have the start of a basketball player here, Puck admitted with a grin.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel smiled, it's possible
None

She definitely likes doing this, but I think it's because daddy got it for her.

None

Maybe, he blushed, catching the ball when Abby tossed it to him, would you be okay with that?

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

With what? Her playing basketball? Of course
None

She can be anything she wants to be, Rachel replied honestly.

None

I feel the same way, he agreed, holding the ball out to Abby and tickling her cheek, making her laugh, I have no clue what you're gonna do when you get older, but I'll support you no matter what, he promised her.

None

She didn't really get what he was saying, but giggled at what he was doing, and then took the ball and walked forward to hug him.

None

Rachel felt tears forming in her eyes and smiled, I don't think she really understood what you said, but it seems like she did.

None

Puck happily returned Abby's hug and kissed her cheek, yeah, seems like it.

None

...

None

They played ball with Abby for a short time, but soon took her into the kitchen for a light lunch
abby has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was beginning to wear down, and after playing around for a little while after she ate, she laid down in her playpen, which was Puck and Rachel's cue that she was tired
None

Carefully picking her up, the couple took her upstairs and settled her in her crib, and the two returned downstairs for some quiet time themselves.

None

As the afternoon wore on, Rachel's dads arrived just before Rachel went to take a shower, so Puck went to pick up her corsage and his boutonniere, returning home when Rachel was finished in the shower, so he took his turn so they could get ready to go
None

A little after four, Puck's family came over, soon followed by Quinn, around the time Abby woke up from her nap
None

While the three teens continued to work on getting ready, the parents took care of Abby and Kona and chatted lightly as time passed.

None

Just after four-thirty, Judy arrived, and she greeted the familiar faces, and met Kona for the first time
None

I hope you're not allergic to or afraid of dogs, Ethan said, while Judy let Kona sniff her her hand.

None

Oh, no, I'm not, for either of them, she replied honestly, petting Kona's head lightly when the dog relaxed and sat looking at her
None

You're awfully cute
None

How hold are you?

None

She's a little over a year
None

We didn't realize she shared her birthday with Abby until a few weeks ago, Deborah commented, when Rachel found her paperwork on her desk.

abby has no Synonyms in the API

Wow! That's coincidental, the older blond woman admitted, moving further into the living room where everyone was, happy belated birthday, Kona and Abby, she added with a smile, glancing at Abby in her playpen.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Kona cocked her head a little at the sound of her name, and then moved back to watching Abby.

None

The kids are all upstairs still getting ready, but have a seat
None

They should be down soon, Alan told her, motioning to the empty chair.

None

As Judy sat down, Puck came downstairs, mostly dressed but holding his tie and jacket, mom, can you..
None

Oh, never mind, he smirked seeing Deborah holding Dena and feeding her a bottle as he came into the living room.

None

Ethan got up and moved towards him, holding out his hand, I can do that, he replied.

None

Thanks, Puck smiled, I guess I better get used to doing it, but I can never get it right.

None

I know
None

I have to wear one with my dress uniform and it's a pain to get done, Ethan wrapped the tie around his own neck and loosely tied the knot and took it off, handing it back to Puck.

['wear', 'one', 'with', 'uniform']

Puck took the tie and put it on, tightening it around his neck, thanks, he said again, fixing his collar around the tie, I'm glad you're here, he said looking up at him and smiling.

None

Me, too, Ethan returned his smile and nodded, ready?

None

Yeah, I think so
None

Rachel's just putting her dress on and Quinn is probably doing the same thing
None

She was fixing her hair in the bathroom when I came down, Puck explained, so once they're done, we're just waiting for the guys to get here and we can go
None

We're meeting Matt, Mercedes, Mike and Brittany at Breadsticks, he added, putting his jacket on.

None

Noah, you look very handsome, Deborah said, laying Dena into her car seat, as she saw him, dressed in a simple black tux jacket and pants, black shoes and tie and a white shirt.

None

Thanks, mom, Puck replied, hugging her when she walked over to him.

None

Just as the two pulled away, Quinn started coming downstairs and Judy gasped when she got down to the bottom of the stairs and could see he dress
None

It was a pale yellow, strapless dress, made with an empire waist, so the chiffon flowed down from her stomach, making it loose and comfortable to dance in

Oh, Quinn, you look so beautiful, Judy smiled, standing up to meet her.

Quinn smiled, thanks

This was the first dress I saw
None

I loved the color and it fit perfectly, so I didn't even bother to try on any more.

None

It's a perfect choice, Deborah smiled, adding another mom opinion to the mix.

None

Rachel will be down in a second
None

She was just putting in her earrings when I came down, Quinn added, hugging her mom and the two moved further into the living room so it wasn't too crowded by the stairs.

None

Hearing footsteps, Puck turned to see Rachel coming down the stairs
None

She was wearing a strapless lavender dress, covered with a soft layer of mesh that had silver patterns drawn randomly over the mesh, giving the dress some texture

Baby, you look amazing, Puck smiled brightly, moving to meet her at the bottom of the stairs.

Rachel returned his smile and took his hand, thank you, sweetheart
None

I'm glad you like it.

None

Puck guided her into the living room and smiled, I love it, Rach.

None

...

None

Sharing compliments and knowing they didn't have long until they needed to leave, they got some pictures of Puck, Rachel and Quinn alone, then with their parents and families and Puck and Rachel as a couple, before Finn, Kurt, Ryan, Ryan's mom, Burt and Carole arrived
parent has no Synonyms in the API

Some more pictures were taken of the three couples, making sure to use Rachel's camera and soon the couples were piling into three cars and heading to Breadsticks to meet Matt and Mercedes, and Mike and Brittany.

None

The five Glee couples got some more pictures as they waited for dinner to arrive and enjoyed hanging out, talking and joking around with each other

None

They took their time eating and had a light desert, before paying their bill and heading out to their cars
None

They didn't want to be at McKinley right as the dance started at seven, but the prom committee asked Finn, Quinn and Puck to be there around then, since they were nominated and they knew if they waited too long they'd have to park further away from the school, so they reluctantly gave in and headed to the dance.

None

A little after seven the five Glee couples walked into the gym, decorated with a Winter Castle theme
theme has no Synonyms in the API
['decorate', 'with', 'theme']

White, silver, black, and various shades of blue balloons were all over the place, and one whole wall was covered in a background that looked like a large picture taken on the side of a mountain
None

Off to one side, where the photographers were taking pictures, a small scene was set up, so the people getting their photo taken would be standing in a walkway of 'snow' that lead up to a castle behind them.

None

The music was already going and a lot of students were already in the middle of the gym dancing along, while some were finding seats at the tables
None

Since the Glee couples had already eaten, they all went right on the dance floor, and fell into a rhythm of dancing, something they weren't used to doing without choreography or singing along to the song being played, but they enjoyed it and after a few upbeat songs, the DJ played a few slower ones.

None

...

None

Around seven-thirty, the head of the prom committee headed up to the small stage where the DJ was
None

After getting everyone's attention, she thanked everyone for coming, reminded them who was nominated for prom king and queen and wished them an enjoyable evening, before letting them get back to dancing.

None

The couples who'd arrived together, slightly split off to do their own thing, but caught sight of the others every once and a while, while on the dance floor and Puck and Rachel also went to talk to Ben and Susan, who were chaperones with Will and Emma that night
None

Puck's aunt and uncle admitted they hadn't wanted to intrude on their night, so they were keeping their distance, but Rachel and Puck quickly assured them they didn't mind and got a few pictures with them and Will and Emma, which caught the other Glee couples attention and soon they were all over at the same table talking, getting pictures and hanging out.

As the night wore on, music rotated from current hits to favorites from the past, from upbeat songs to ballads, keeping things mixed up so the teens didn't get bored
None

Just before nine, the committee leader asked everyone to start casting their votes for prom king and queen, if they hadn't already, and soon all the attendees were slowly making their way towards one of the several ballot boxes to vote.

None

They let voting go until nine-thirty and after a final call, the committee took the boxes and went to tally the votes
None

It didn't take too long and just before ten, Figgins and a few committee members went up onto the stage and while two of them held velvet pillows with the king and queen crowns and scepters, the other handed Figgins two envelopes.

['hold', 'pillow', 'with', 'king']

Figgins tapped the microphone a few times to catch the attention of everyone and as the teens quieted down, he smiled, it's now time to announce who you chose as your Prom King and Prom Queen for the class of 2011, he started, earning cheering from the crowd as he opened the envelope and pulled out the card for king, your Prom King is..
None

He paused for a brief moment, before looking in the directions of Puck, Mr
None

Noah 'Puck' Puckerman!

None

A spotlight hit Puck and Rachel in the face as Puck's mouth fell open in shock, what? He glanced at Rachel, completely stunned, before looking at Finn, who clapped and smiled at him.

None

Noah, you won! Congratulations! Rachel grinned brightly, hugging him quickly and nudging him towards the stage.

None

Shaking out of his shock, he moved down the path the students cleared, allowing him to get to the stage and as he stepped up to it, he shook Figgins hand and turned to stand facing everyone
None

Figgins took the king's crown and placed it on his head and then picked up the scepter, waving it over his head a few times before handing it to him, along with the card and envelope showing he'd won, congratulations, King Puckerman, Figgins replied, holding up the last envelope and opened it
None

Pulling out the card, he read over the name and curiously stared at it, before reading the note at the bottom.

None

Figgins glanced at the committee curiously, the three on stage nodded and motioned for him to continue, so he turned back to the teens, they've written out what they want me to say, so here it is, he took a deep breath, though underclassmen can't be nominated for Prom King or Prom Queen, there is nothing in the rule book about them winning from write-in votes on the ballots
None

For the first time in over ten years, your Prom Queen is an underclassmen who received the most write-in votes, he paused and smiled, and your Prom Queen is Ms
None

Rachel Berry, he finished, clapping as the light panned to Rachel.

None

It took Rachel a moment to realize her named had been called and when it hit her, her hand flew to her mouth in shock and she looked at her boyfriend
None

He, along with the rest of the attendees were clapping and cheering, and she felt her cheeks flush.

None

Realizing that Rachel wasn't moving, Quinn stepped a few feet closer to her and rested a hand on her shoulder, congratulations Rachel, she said, leaning close so she could hear, now you need to go get your crown.

None

Turning to look at Quinn, Rachel felt tears in her eyes from shock, but you...

None

Quinn shook her head, you won fair and square
None

You deserve it, she glanced up to see Puck on the stage, and then turned her gaze back to the new queen, your king is waiting.

None

Taking a deep breath, Rachel nodded and made her way towards the stage
None

Now that the initial shock was wearing off, her thoughts began to race in curiosity and she also felt fear building in the pit of her stomach
None

She didn't know how she got that many votes and couldn't help worrying that it was meant to be a joke, but she pushed aside her fears for the moment to get to her boyfriend
None

Smiling at the teens she passed, who were still clapping and saying 'congratulations' to her, she reached the edge of the stage and took her boyfriend's offered hand to help her up and as she came face-to-face with him, her cheeks continued to flush and she bit her lip nervously, Noah, I don't know how this happened.

Puck smiled at her and shrugged, neither do I, he pressed a kiss to her lips, but it's awesome.

None

Rachel blushed and nodded at him, seeing Figgins waiting, so she took a deep breath and moved to stand next to Puck
None

Facing everyone, she took Puck's hand and squeezed it as she soaked in the once-in-a-lifetime moment she and Puck were experiencing together.

None

Figgins stepped over to her and carefully placed the jeweled crown on her head, and waved the scepter over her before handing it to her and going back to the microphone, congratulations Mr
None

Puckerman and Ms
None

Berry, he turned to face the crowd, I present to you your Prom 2011 King and Queen, he clapped as the rest of the audience of classmates and friends cheered again
None

Stepping towards them, he smiled, do you have a request for your first dance? Figgins asked.

None

No, I..
None

I haven't thought of one..
None

I should have a few picked out, but I never thought this could happen, Rachel replied honestly.

None

Puck squeezed her hand and kissed her cheek, I have one, he said, pulling out a thumb drive from his pocket and stepping over to the DJ to hand it to him
None

Returning to his girlfriend, he held out his hand, can I have this dance, My Queen?

None

Of course, Rachel smiled brightly and took his hand
None

They passed their scepters off to Figgins to hold and Rachel let Puck guide her off the stage and to the center of the floor, where the students were clearing a large space for them to dance and the spotlights lit up the area, Noah, what's the song?

None

Just listen to the words, he replied softly, wrapping one of his arms around her and taking one of her hands in his, I found it when I was looking through some of mom's CDs for songs to request tonight
None

This was the one I loved the most and was gonna ask the DJ to play it tonight, but I didn't expect it to be now, he replied honestly.

None

Rachel slid her free arm around his waist and looked at him, I'm sure it will be wonderful, she smiled, holding back tears as the introduction began to play, featuring a harmonica, something that wasn't heard often anymore.

None

After a few moments, a male voice began singing the first verse and though she thought she recognized it, she couldn't place him, 

None



None

Rachel's eyes widened at the meaning of the words, and she smiled brightly as they swayed together to the music, feeling tears falling from her eyes
None

She already loved the song, though she couldn't place the voice or title, but she focused on the words, just like he asked and tried to keep her emotions from spilling over.

None



None

 The chorus of the song was sung by a group of male voices and Puck reached up to gently wipe her tears away, as he lightly sang along with the words, only familiar with the chorus, because he hadn't known it for very long.

 Another male voice sang the next verse, with the other male voices backing up on some of the lyrics.

The voices continued on to sing the chorus again and Rachel let go of Puck's hand to wrap her other arm around him, snugging close, I love you so much, Noah.

None

Puck smiled at his girlfriend and kissed her cheek as his other arm found a comfortable place to rest around her, I love you, too, Rachel, and I always will, he replied honestly, his own tears building as the group sang the bridge of the song, 

None



None

While the group of voices sang the chorus once more, Rachel stood up a little taller and pressed a kiss to her boyfriend's lips
None

She let their kiss linger for a few moments, before pulling back slightly and smiling again, the song is beautiful and I'll never forget it
None

I love it and I think it should be our song, because I feel the same way.

None



None

 as the last few words were sung, Puck returned Rachel's smile and nodded, yeah? You do? But what about our others?

None

They're all amazing, but the words in this one are perfect and I think it fits us, she told him, reaching up to rest her hands on his cheeks, and you picked it out for us, just like you did with 'Sweet Caroline'

They're not just songs we've done in Glee or ones our family liked or suggested, she added as Figgins came up to them and returned their scepters and Puck's thumb drive.

The couple nodded their thanks to him and joined hands, moving towards the edge of the dance area, wanting a breather from dancing, which also gave Puck a chance to think about what she said
None

You're right, babe, he said, it should definitely be our song.

None

Rachel smiled at him and nodded, awesome! It's official, she confirmed, squeezing his hand as their friends came over to meet them, it's our song.

Some were heading home, while others were going off to after-prom activities or to a late night meal

A little after eleven, Puck and Rachel decided to head home

It didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but I'll never forget it.

Neither will I, he agreed, wrapping his arms around her and kissing her gently, I'm still shocked we won, but I'm not complaining
None

The crown is perfect for you.

Rachel reached up and touched the crown she still had on and smiled, part of me doesn't believe it really happened, but I know it did, she said honestly, taking it off to look at the jewels
None

I'm not a Senior and I definitely wasn't nominated, so I don't know how or why they picked me, which made me really nervous for a while
None

At first, I kinda thought I was voted queen as some kind of joke and at some point someone was going to throw a slushy on me, she explained, taking a deep breath and shaking the thoughts from her mind, but everyone seemed happy and supportive, so it helped me relax and enjoy the night.

None

I could tell you were nervous, but I never would have let anything happen to you, he assured her, kissing her forehead, and don't think about the 'how' or 'why'

As soon as Figgins started talking about underclassmen winning from write-in votes, I was hoping he was going to say your name and when he did, it was a dream come true!

None

It definitely was a dream come true, she agreed, leaning up to press a kiss to his lips, and thank you for what you said and for voting for me
None

I voted for you, too, and I feel like tonight was meant to be this way.

None

I think so, too, he nodded, kissing her once more, and I don't know about you, he paused, gently raising his hand to rest on the small zipper under her arm that held her dress closed, but I was thinking we could

If you don't know, I'm a major fan of *NSYNC and was crying when I saw them reunited on the MTV VMAs back in August! I've been a fan since their Disney concert in '98 and always will be! When going through songs to use for Puck and Rachel's first dance as king and queen, I wasn't sure what to go with, but as I got to their music on my iTunes list, I thought of their amazing ballads and I went for this one on their 'Celebrity' album, because I felt this song fit perfectly.

 'We Are The Champions' - Queen, but I went more with the version that New Directions sung in episode '3x21 - Nationals' of Glee

I've always loved this song and it's been redone by many artists and groups, and also featured in many movies and TV shows

The Glee version is okay (I like that the show did it to celebrate New Directions' win, but there are a few cast member's voices I don't like, so I'd rather not hear them.), but my favorite use of the song is at the end of 'D2 - Mighty Ducks', when Team USA was celebrating their win around a campfire.

 I don't know about you, but when I was in high school, prom was only for Seniors

Like next year at Rachel's Senior prom, she can have Puck attend, because he just graduated the year before)

That's how I set up their proms - from how my high school did it (though I refused to go to my prom, but I knew the rules)

I've never known anyone who's school had prom for all grades, like they did in Glee

It was closure for me and the show, by saying 'goodbye to Cory/Finn and also watching Puck's last appearance..
None

I will continue writing, though, so don't worry..
None

When I heard news about Puck's plans and then saw it in the show, I couldn't help getting giddy, realizing that he was joining the Air Force..
None

It's like I called him joining the military years ago and I know I'm not the only one who did; other authors have, too! Granted, in 'Out of the Blue', my Puck is not joining for the same reasons Puck in Glee is or joining the same branch of the military, but he's still joining the military and I'm amazed that I've been planning that for years and now he is in the show! Talk about a shock to me! I truly think Puck in Glee will do well in the military and I know my Puck will be very successful in his chosen military career.

Is everybody ready for their performances?

None

Most definitely-

None

Not!

None

The owner of that last comment glanced across the room to the fuming girl staring back at him
None

He had to admit he found it cute when she scrunched up her nose with disgust, probably because of his hairstyle as a wicked mohawk

All a better reason to make fun of her.

None

Mr
None

Schuester ignored both of his student's comments and held a raven bowler, which seemed to resemble the infamous slapstick performer Charlie Chaplin's hat.

None

The regular iconoclast fashionista of the group had their hazel eyes on the hat
None

That would look so good with my outfit tomorrow

Mr

Schuester glanced from the bowler grasped gently in his hands to the twinkling eyes of Kurt Hummel
None

After I'm done with this Kurt.

Kurt started to beam like there was no tomorrow and clapped his hands with joy

Mr

Schuester cleared his throat to get everyone's attention
None

Okay well in this hat is a-

None



None

 hat.

None

â€¦In Kurt's hat is a-

None

My 

None

 hat.

None

The teacher gave Kurt a sideways glance, to see if he was going to interrupt him anymore
None

Knowing that Kurt got what he wanted anyway, he sighed and continued with what he was trying to say
None

â€¦In Kurt's new hat, is a thin sheet of paper with everyone's name written on it
None

Also in the hat is a list of different songs that you will be singing to as a warm-up for today's class
None

Do you all understand that?

None

Absolutely-

None

Not!

None

Ooh, catfight, they never have any good ones on television anymore, Kurt whispered happily to his sassy friend Mercedes Jones' ear.

None

Must you interrupt everything I say? the voice of Rachel Berry enquired to the footballer in the other side of the room, who in return just smirked.

None

Must you be all peeved about it? Noah Puckerman retorted back.

None

Offended, Rachel scoffed
None

I am not; I just think your attitude is annoying.

None

And what, your voice isn't? I swear it kills my eardrums everytime you open your mouth.

None

Well guess what buddy, you being here doesn't make me feel better either
None

I mean, what kind of hair is that? It would put the Glee club to shame.

None

I soo agree with you on that Rach, about the mohawk part
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

You need to make it have a little more 'shine' then everyone will love you, Kurt interrupted, emphasizing his words to the football player.

None

Guys, enough
None

You have to stop arguing with each other every lesson okay? Because of this, Rachel and Puck will not be performing first, Mr

None

Schuester stated firmly, getting annoyed that many people were either interrupting him, or forgot that he was in the same room as them
None

Rachel gasped in horror, while Puck just shrugged his shoulders, not really caring at all.

None

Sigh, if only I had popcorn with me, Kurt remarked to himself.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

That goes for you too Kurt, you're not performing first or getting the bowler hat, the teacher stated, annoyed on Kurt with his witty and sarcastic words.

word has no Synonyms in the API
None

Kurt's mouth dropped open, like it was the worst thing to happen to him ever
None

What? Well, I'm not trusting another teacher's word ever again
None

He crossed his arms across his chest, huffing and moving his body away from the teacher.

None

Mr
None

Schuester chuckled at his student's words while picking a name from the hat
None

He glanced around the room, trying to find the first victim to perform
None

Artie Abrams.

None

The paraplegic manual wheelchair user moved his wheelchair towards the smiling teacher, who handed him the hat to pick a random song to sing to
None

Artie picked one, smiling at whatever he chose that was written on that thin strip of translucent paper.

None

He never got to say what his selected song was, because someone else had beaten him to it â€“ as in interrupted him by an unfair statement on his condition.

None

Go wheelies.

None

Puck, why do you have to be such a tightass?

None

Berry, why do you always have slushie facials? Oh yeah, because you're annoying and ugly!

None

Why don't you just go-

None

SHUT UP!

None

Everyone turned to where the sudden outburst came from, none other than a flush-faced Finn Hudson
None

Mr
None

Schue gave Finn a small smile, thanking him for that
None

He turned towards the two teens that were giving each other a 'glare off', and sighed
None

When can they ever get along?

None

Rachel and Puck, I don't want to do this but you're staying back after Glee class is over, Mr
None

Schuester stated, very seriously.

None

Yet again, Rachel gasped with horror, while Puck just rolled his eyes and glanced at the ceiling, but not before running a hand through his mohawk, winking at Rachel
horror has no Synonyms in the API
None

Said girl just scoffed, and crossed her arms across her lime green jumper, watching Artie perform his performance
None

What she didn't know was that he was still staring at her.

None

Somehow, Puck always found himself never looking away from the wannabe diva, and for once, he didn't have an actual answer on why he was
None

Sure, she was 'attractable' but he found her annoying, boring at times and the number one person to easily mess and mock with
None

Whenever he would say a sly comment to a fellow McKinley High female student, they would either be shy or get embarrassed, because it was the Noah Puckerman that was talking to them.

None

However, his persuasion powers didn't work on one person â€“ Rachel Berry
None

He found it terrible, but also a turn-on
None

She was like a challenge, and he didn't like to back down from one.

None

He had to admit, the lime green jumper she was wearing seemed to make her chocolate eyes pop out and her mocha hair blended well with the combination
combination has no Synonyms in the API
None

Her yellow pleated skirt a few inches above the knee made his umâ€¦ 'manhood' department go all funny
None

Puck muttered something inwardly, not even hearing the bell ring.

None

He understood class was over when he only saw Mr
None

Schuester fixing his paperwork, and Rachel and Finn talking to each other in the doorwayâ€¦ wait, Rachel and Finn talking?

None

Puck turned his head to perceive his best friend saying something to her, and she laughed
None

What caught Puck's attention was that Finn was staring at her and smiling sweetly when she chuckled
None

Oddly, Puck felt a bitâ€¦ he didn't know what it was to be honest.

None

He got up and headed towards his next class when Mr
None

Schuester called him and Rachel
None

He turned to see Rachel glaring at him
None

Of course to balance things up, he smirked
None

Well what are we waiting for darling? Mr
None

Schue wants us.

None

Don't ever call me that, Rachel threatened, stalking off to the teacher
None

Smirking, he followed suit to see Mr
None

Schuester holding a few sheets of paper, who glanced back towards the two meddling teens.

None

I will be honest, ever since Puck joined Glee; you two have been going off at each other a lot
None

Is there a time when you two ever spoken without resulting it to be an argument? he questioned, eyeing both students.

None

Yeah, in my dreams, Rachel announced, wanting to get to class immediately.

None

Puck eyed her
None

So, you have dreams of me? I don't always go for the wannabe divas, but for you I can make an exception.

None

Rachel's eyes widened, disgusted
None

It's an expression you perve.

None

Mr
None

Schuester mentally slapped his forehead
None

See what I mean? You're both doing it again
None

Look, is there a way that you two can at least pretend to get along?

None

Even if it's pretend, I do not want to associate myself with a pervert like him, Rachel declared, pointing an accusing finger at the bad boy.

pervert has no Synonyms in the API
['associate', '-PRON-', 'with', 'pervert']

Puck gasped, smirking a little and stepping aside so Rachel was pointing at Mr
None

Schuester
None

Are you calling Mr
None

Schue a pervert? Wow, that's a bit extreme don't you think?

None

Rachel glowered at Puck
None

I was pointing to you, imbecile.

None

Before anything could happen next, Mr
None

Schuester stepped in between the two, restraining them from biting each other's heads off
None

I can't deal with you two quarreling with each other anymore
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Instead, you both have to do a performance.

None

Rachel's anger died down from hearing those words, smiling from ear to ear
None

Puck just stared at the girl who had a sudden split personality change
None

He had to admit, he found that hot.

None

Together.

None

Rachel's emotions faded away to one of utter annoyance and disgust
None

What?

None

Puck just placed his hand on her shoulder, patting it
None

Don't worry; I won't biteâ€¦ unless you want me to.

None

Mr
None

Schue, with all due respect, why do you want me to suffer with thisâ€¦ this thing!? Rachel argued, while Puck got annoyed that he was called a 'thing'.

Isn't that what you want to be? Mr
None

Schuester asked, his voice showing concern to the female student.

None

Of course I want to be famous, Rachel pointed out matter-of-factly.

None

Puck rolled his eyes
None

You didn't have to overreact about the whole situation
None

Oh, and by the way, I am not a thing
None

I'm a 

None

 thing, he added, smirking.

None

Interfering once again, Mr
None

Schuester handed the two sheets of paper
None

These are your songs for the week, I want you two to choose between these songs and make a mash up
None

You will present it to the class next Monday, and I will be expecting a lot from the both of you.

None

Also, I will be grading you
None

If you don't do well from what I see, you will both be kicked out from Glee
None

Got it? he ended, glancing at each of their reactions.

None

He got what he wanted from Rachel â€“ a shrill, but it didn't seem to bother Puck
None

As well as off the football team, Mr
None

Schuester added.

None

Puck's monotonous expression changed to one of annoyance and fury, something Mr
None

Schuester tried not to smirk at
None

Fuck.

None

Excuse me, but language, Rachel uttered.

None

I'm sorry for not acting like a pissy priss like you are, Puck retorted with.

None

They were once again interrupted, but not by Mr
None

Schuester
None

There standing at the door was none other than the divine Kurt
None

He tapped his foot impatiently, giving Rachel a stare down
None

What happened to, I have to go get a drink? I can see you are gulping down something alright, he articulated, moving his hazel eyes in the direction of Puck.

None

And seriously, your 'hawk really needs to have some spunk to it, Kurt advised to Puck, who seemed to give him in return the stink-eye.

None

Kurt took the hint, but kept going with his 'man-to-man' conversation

What? I'm like saving all the little strands of your hair from embarrassment!

None

Mr
None

Schuester motioned Rachel and Puck to return to their classes, giving both of them late passes
None

They both grabbed one and made their way departing the room
None

Of course an argument has erupted before they even stepped foot out of the door.

None

Walk faster Puck.

None

Make me.

None

I don't see the big deal of this; just move your legs with more speed.

None

What?! Oh god no! I swear Noah Puckerman; you are nothing but aâ€¦ argh!

None

Keep telling yourself that.

None

Two minutes after the meddling duo left, Kurt was still at the door, watching Puck and Rachel have a go at each other from the hallway
None

When he knew they had turned a corner and were out of earshot, he briskly entered the room, heading in Mr
None

Schuester's direction.

None

Mr
None

Schuester turned to Kurt
None

Your right, they just keep biting each other's heads off
None

It's getting to the point when it's just plain annoying and not fun anymore.

None

Kurt placed his hands on his heart
None

I said almost the exact same thing
None

What it was exactly I can't remember but it was almost the same.

None

I hope your plan works Kurt
None

I'm counting on you to make it happen, Mr
None

Schuester assured to the fashionista boy.

None

My plans always work, even if all of them are to do with fashion
fashion has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'with', 'fashion']

But Rachel and Puck are like a pair of socks and shoes â€“ the socks want to be cleaned, while the shoes want to be dirty
None

Either way they can't stand each other and it's perfect, Kurt said, doing his fingers in a Mr
None

Burns-esque style.

None

Do they know about this?

None

Of course 'they' do
None

Well 'they they' don't, but 'they' do? Does that make any sense at all? Geez, I need to go shopping later.

None

Mr
None

Schuester believed his words â€“ before his shopping speech, but he felt like he was here for something else
None

Kurt, why are you really here?

None

Fine, I came for my hat, Kurt confessed.

None

But I said that it's not your-

None

He never finished it because Kurt snatched it from where it laid on top of the piano, running carefully as not to damage his attire.

None

Mr
None

Schuester chuckled, picking up his suitcase and walking out of the room, mumbling one thing more to himself than to anyone
None

This plan better work or so help me!

None

Walk faster Puck.

None

Make me.

None

I don't see the big deal of this; just move your legs with more speed.

None

Keep telling yourself that.

None

Argh, why can't you dimwit just leave me alone, Rachel bitterly exclaimed, pacing faster to get away from her worst nightmare
None

Unfortunately for her, Puck seemed to catch on to her actions.

None

Wow, your skirt just bounces everywhere when you are trying to get away from me
None

You have got to stop doing this to me Berry, you're killing me, Puck exclaimed, placing a hand on his heart, smirking.

None

Rachel stopped ambling, resulting to Puck almost falling on top of her
None

She turned around, twirling her chocolate hair and glared at Puck dangerously
None

Before she could say anything at all, there were three things she noticed right away
None

One, his mocha eyes that had a flash of green looked exotic
None

Two, his face was only inches away from hers
None

And three, wasn't that person running in their direction â€“

None

Get out of my way or you will crush my newly beloved! A very familiar voice echoed through the hallway, and ran past where Puck and Rachel just happened to be standing
None

Touch her and you will suffer with my mad dancing skills

They had seemed to be clutching on some sort of bowler hat which looked strangely and utterly like the one Kurt was begging Mr
None

Schue to give to him.

None

Rachel and Puck both ignored the figure that just zoomed past them, and proceeded with their bickering argument
argument has no Synonyms in the API
None

I swear you have no respect for girls whatsoever, Rachel screeched at Puck.

None

Puck made a 'psshh' sound, not really caring

For your information Berry, I do have respect for the ladies, especially if they do the one thing that I want from them, he retorted, winking.

None

Rachel scoffed, disgusted with his implications
implication has no Synonyms in the API

That is just vulgar and totally unloyal

You should be ashamed of yourself.

Puck's gaze now went to his shoes, kicking them on the ground a little

I know what you mean, and I absolutely agree with you.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Rachel was taken aback with his words
word has no Synonyms in the API

Did he really regret all his past actions? Maybe deep down he wasn't the crude pervert that always had to have a pointless verbal conversation with her
None

Maybe deep down in that cold black heart of his with the lock wrapped around it was something bright red, glowing inside and ready to be let out
None

Yeah, that seemed like a fair enough answer.

None

And because of that, you should spank me, he added, wiggling his eyebrows mischieviously.

None

Scratch that long thought.

None

Horrified, Rachel opened her mouth to rebut, but Puck bet her to it
None

I've been a bad boy, and I need to come to my senses
None

I think I need a good girl to come and fix this screwed up problem of mine, andâ€¦ did you put your hand up? Well, 

None

 can be the first to help me change this bad boy, Puck whispered seductively in her ear.

None

Rachel squealed with anger
anger has no Synonyms in the API

Eww, I would never associate myself with a disgusting pervert like you

She crossed her arms across her chest, raising an eyebrow and glancing at Puck sternly
None

Puck seemed to find it adorable that her facial expression looked like something Bambi would do.

None

You so want this hunk of candy, Puck pointed out, his thumbs referring to himself obviously
None

This resulted to an eye roll from the diva, who began to walk away from him.

None

Oh yeah definitely
None

I want you Puckâ€¦ to leave me alone! And with that, she stormed off to class.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck watched her retreating form, chuckling a little
None

Did she not know where her Maths class was? Hey beautiful, your class is the other way, he shouted.

None

Next thing to happen, Rachel paced in the opposite direction, to where her Maths class really was
None

I knew that, she mumbled.

None

Her hushed response just made him smirk more
None

Sure you did, gorgeous.

None

Stop calling me those icky nicknames Puck.

None

You know you love them, honey bunny.

None

I hate you Noah Puckerman, deep down I really do.

None

As she turned a corner, disappearing from his sights, Puck turned the other way and headed for his History class, sneering at the girl's response
None

She so wants me.

None

Lunchtime at McKinley High should be a time where people aren't stressed right? You're definitely completely and utterly wrong about that, especially when the topic is aboutâ€¦

None

I swear to the Holy Man above us, they really need to be locked in a closet together.

Seriously, can you imagine if they actually get together and later on got married? And if they had a kid?

But he

But they have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever!

None

Mercedes and Artie, as well as their Asian-American Goth friend Tina Cohen-Chang were discussing the one thing everyone in Glee wants to happen â€“ the beauty and the beast to hook up
None

Before they could continue their debate in the cafeteria, a bouncy Kurt joined them, smiling for joy.

None

Guess what guys, you would not believe it!

None

Did Mr
None

Schue join in on the plan? Mercedes enquired to her fashionista friend.

None

What? Oh thatâ€¦ yeah he did, but that's not important right now
None

I think I'm in love, Kurt gushed, placing his hands on his heart.

None

With whom? Whom? Mercedes grabbed his wrist, demanding answers while Artie and Tina nodded, wanting to know themselves.

None

Kurt flashed a smirk to his bootylicious friend
None

Let's just say that when I first saw her, it was definitely love at first sight
None

Screw my car, I have a new love and it will be magnificent.

None

Ooh, wh-where is sh-she? Tina stuttered, growing more curious as to who has bitten Kurt with the love bug.

Kurt's smile just grew bigger

Ladies, and Artie, I present to you my new love, he announced, placing that infamous bowler hat on the table
None

Mercedes, Artie and Tina whipped their heads around as to find Kurt's mysteriously 'new girl' but the only girls they saw were Quinn, Brittany and Santana who just walked into the cafeteria.

None

Mercedes turned and gave Kurt an evil glare
None

Are you stupid or something? You're in love with one of the cheerios? I'm pretty sure you are using too much conditioner for that hair of yours.

OMG you did not just say that! As if I would go with a cheerio, I mean have you seen the hair products they use? He turned to where the Cheerios sat in the popular table with the other members of their elite group and the jocks, and faced Mercedes to continue with what he was saying

To prove his point, he flipped his hair around, resulting to an eye roll from Mercedes and a sigh from Artie.

None

Tina seemed confused
None

Th-then who are y-you in l-lo-love with?

None

Kurt's smile got bigger once again
None

Introducing Katy, he again announced, letting go of his bowler hat
None

Again, Mercedes, Artie and Tina whipped their heads around to the cafeteria entrance, seeing only Finn, Matt, Mike and Puck who had entered, making their way to the popular table
None

What surprised the trio was that Puck turned in their direction then swiftly faced his jock buddies.

None

How peculiar.

None

However, they were more focused on who this 'Katy' person was
None

Kurt cleared his throat, their attention facing him, who looked grumpy
None

You are being disrespectful to Katy.

None

Artie looked confused
None

Doesn't she want us looking for her?

None

Kurt slapped his forehead like it was the most stupidest question he had ever heard

To him, it was the most stupidest question he had ever heard

Kurt was getting more annoyed at the fact that his Glee friends were not even decoding the fact on Katy even with them

He put the bowler hat on his gorgeous mop of chestnut hair, tapping it slightly, and pointing at the hat to his friends.

None

No offense Kurt, but you look stupid pointing to that hat ofâ€¦ wait, isn't that the hat that you begged Mr
None

Schue to give to you? Mercedes asked, curious.

None

Why yes, thanks for the observation my dear.

None

But I th-th-thought Mr
None

Sch-Schue said th-that you co-couldn't g-g-get it an-any-anymore? Tina furthermore questioned.

None

Kurt simply pulled the hat off his head, placing it on the table
None

It's a free country; I can do anything I want with Katy.

Artie was drinking an apple-flavoured slushie when he heard what his buddy had just said, resulting to him spitting out the green-coloured drink from his mouth, causing a few onlookers
None



None

 is Katy? he enquired, pointing to the hat.

None

Kurt gasped, clutching Katy to his chest
None

You say it like it's a bad thing
None

Well, you're just jealous because I have good taste
None

He then turned to Katy, a lovestruck expression on his visage
None

It's okay baby waby, Artie Fartie did not mean what he saidy waidy.

None

Yeah, Artie said, until realizing what Kurt meant
None

Hey! he yelled.

None

Sorry Artie, but I'm not in the mood for greetings, Rachel out of no-where exclaimed, sitting down next to Kurt and banging her head on the table
None

Kurt rubbed her back, acting all sympathetic
None

Honey, I wouldn't do that if I were you
None

I mean, you would get bruises on your face and people would think you got attacked by a warthog or worse, a meerkat.

None

Kurt, that was a really bad simile, Artie articulated, wiping some of the green slushie he spitted out before off of his cream jumper.

None

It was not a simile, and it was the first thing I could think of, okay? GOSH! The Lion King like immediately popped up into my mind
None

What a good film, Kurt uttered, staring off into a blind spot and just admiring it
None

Scar's mane was soo hot, and his eyes were soo sexy.

None

Going off topic here
None

Anyways, Rachel what is making you all tensed and stressed? Mercedes asked
None

She actually knew the answer, but she just wanted her friend to confirm her assumptions.

None

That idiot with the stupid mohawk plastered on the middle of his bald head! she screeched, many people now glancing at her sudden outburst
None

Puck from across the room was one of the people that glanced, and knew she was talking about him when she heard him yell out, Idiot
None

He figured she was defiantly speaking about him as he was the only one who would piss her off in the first place.

None

He couldn't believe he was actually thinking this, but he found Rachel hot when she was in her breaking point
None

Now all he had to do was push her buttons a little bit, then like an egg, she would crack
None

Slowly, he got off his seat, grabbed his mango-flavoured slushie, excused himself from his teammates and headed towards his fellow Glee club members
None

He smirked when he saw Mercedes, Tina and Artie look at him
None

However, he wondered why they were smirking slightly at him
None

Nevertheless, he continued to smirk and sat next to Rachel
None



None

, you're gonna damage that pretty face of yours.

None

This got Rachel's attention, who was now glowering at the bad boy
None

What the hell did you just call me?

None

Sneering, Puck continued
None

Berry my princess fairy, God won't be impressed that you said the H word, so now he is going to send you to hell
None

Oh, I said it too, so I guess we will both end up in hell
None

At least I know you will accompany me there, and maybe do something more than thatâ€¦ Taking his chances, he placed an arm around Rachel's shoulder, waiting for her to scream.

None

Puck, first of all, stop giving me those yuck nicknames
None

They sound so derogatory, so stop
None

Second, this is why I said you were a pervert, because you think like one and because you are one!

None

One, you love it when I call you those names with my super sexy voice

['call', '-PRON-', 'with', 'voice']

Two, I'm not a perve and if I was, how am I one?

None

For starters, you always seem to be staring either at my chest or my ass, and if not, you're thinking about it!

None

Wow, it seems like you have given this question a lot of thought
None

Proves that you dig me.

None

Oh yeah, definitely.

None

Hah! Knew it! Mike and Matt owe me five bucks now, score!

None

It's called sarcasm, you baboon, go look it up in a dictionary, if you have one.

None

That's easy
None

I have the

 position
None

See? '

None

?' I'm so smart!

None

Oh you are smart alrightâ€¦ you smart asshole! And get your arm off me!

None

While they continued with yet again another quarrel, they didn't realize that the majority of everyone in the cafeteria, even the lunch lady was staring wide-eyed at this verbal argument
None

What they also didn't realize was that Kurt, Mercedes, Artie and Tina had ditched them and were now sitting with the rest of the Glee members, watching this crazy fiasco.

rest has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'rest']

Get a room! Mike shouted from the table
None

The only response he got â€“ Puck giving him the finger, his eyes still intact with Rachel, yelling out either flirtatious comments or comebacks that was sure to piss her off.

None

Seriously, if I could be bothered to, I would record this and put it on YouTube
None

It would smash more than a million in less than an hour, Finn said, his eyes still on the feud.

None

She soo wants him
None

She complains about him more than she does about you two, Mercedes commented, looking back and forth at Finn and Quinn when she said that
None

No offense or anything.

None

Quinn gritted her teeth
None

None taken.

None

So the plan is set in motion? Artie enquired in his wheelchair, with Tina standing next to him.

None

Quinn grinned devilishly
None

Duh! It will be effective after the bell rings.

None

Finn smiled lovingly at his girlfriend
None

You're so devious, and that's why I fell for you
None

Yeah, next thing you know, the two of them were making out.

None

Mike shielded his eyes in a joking manner
None

Geez, and yet I say that they should get a room? Them referring to obviouslyâ€¦ we all know who.

None

Yeah, go join them and do a foursome while you're at it, Kurt added, adjusting Katy in many positions on his head.

None

Finn stopped the make out session to glance at Kurt confusingly
None

Isn't that the hat from Mr
None

Schue that he said you couldn't have?

None

He didn't say that I couldn't have itâ€¦ okay, he said I couldn't have it, but Katy was a damsel in distress, and she was calling me to take her away from her captorâ€¦

None

Wait, you stole it from Mr
None

Schue?

None

It's a free country
None

I'm pretty sure Obama would do the same thing if it was a free donuts day thing
None

What I would give to have one of those vanilla glazed ones with a pink umbrella on topâ€¦

Finn glanced at Tina, Mercedes and Artie, more confused, giving them a 'what-the-fuck-is-he-on-about' expression
None

Mercedes just chuckled as Kurt was still going on about his latest desire
None

Trust me, you don't wanna know.

None

Before Finn could say anything, there was a shrill
None

Everyone of them turned their heads, seeing and hearingâ€¦

None

You pervert! What the hell was that?

None

What the hell was what? You overreact too much you know that?

None

I should overreact; I mean you just touched my ass!

None

I didn't touch it, I was trying to cope a feel!

None

Same thing dipshit.

None

Kurt rolled his eyes at the two, blaming them for ruining his one-on-one time with him and Katy
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

As if it was alive, he patted Katy, loving the feel of velvet pressed gently on his hand
None

Pity, the moment was already ruined.

No they are not; they are two very different words with different meanings

AGHHH! Noah Puckerman, you are a buffoon, you know that?!

None

Meh, been called worse than that, cherry Berry.

None

AGHHH!

None

Kurt sighed and turned to the two that were acting like 'a married couple'
None

I hate it when mummy and daddy fight.

None

You pervert! What the hell was that?

None

What the hell was what? You overreact too much you know that?

RING!!! The bell went, commencing the rest of the day's classes.

None

Before Puck could interject with anything, he got the surprise of his life
anything has no Synonyms in the API
None

Someone had just slushied Rachelâ€¦ and it wasn't him
None

He glanced in the direction to where the slushie had come from, just to see some random holding 

None

 slushie
None

He turned to his right to perceive Rachel covered in orange goo hyperventilating and although slimed with mango-flavoured slushie, she was trying to hold back the tears
slushie has no Synonyms in the API
None

She couldn't take it anymore and fled the cafeteria, everyone watching her retreating form.

None

Puck instantly felt guilty for even buying that slushie
None

He didn't even like the flavour and yet he bought it
None

What a waste of two dollars and fifty cents
None

He then remembered that the guy that slushied Rachel was still standing there wearing a pair of oversized sunnies, a jersey jacket and oddly a bowler hat, still holding his slushie.

None

Angrily, he got up, grabbed the random by the jacket and dragged him out of the cafeteria
None

He pulled him into a corner where not much people would see this, and whispered threateningly in his ear
None

Nobody messes with Rachel but me got it? So you better not go near her ever again, or you are going to result to me and I'm going to teach you a lesson about it, got it?

rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

The poor random person nodded his head repeatedly, fearing for his life
None

Puck smirked that nearly everyone in McKinley High feared him, except for his football teammates, the Glee club, Mr
None

Schue and Rachel.

None

At the thought of Rachel, his smirk died down, almost feeling sorry for notâ€¦ protecting her
None

Sure, he had a go at her by throwing several slushies on her face, but that was before he joined Glee
None

Now that he did, he just couldn't do it anymore, and now seeing someone else that was not him do that to her made him realize how she felt
None

She was vulnerable, and needed to be protected.

None

And as much clichÃ©d as it sounds, Puck needed to be her knight in shining armour
None

Of course Puck smirked at that, releasing his grip on the random kid
None

Puck said one more thing to the random, And you owe me five dollars and an apple-flavoured slushie for that.

None

The random just blinked, confused
None

But a slushie costs two fifty, and wasn't the flavour mango?

None

Puck just smirked
None

Now you owe me five bucks dude
None

But do that to her againâ€¦ he began to crack his knuckles and flex his muscles to prove his point, while the random shook his head repetitively again.

None

Good
None

Next thing to happen, Puck grabbed the random and brought him into the guy's bathrooms, before saying, I'm going to show you what happens incase you forget what I mean.

None

Thirty minutes laterâ€¦

None

Puck left the guy's bathroom with a sneer on his face, cracking his knuckles and heading to class, while the random never came out of the bathroom
sneer has no Synonyms in the API
None

For all we know, Puck could have murdered the poor bloke
None

Oh well, we don't really care about him..
None

or do we?

None

Puck was heading in the direction of his English class, knowing he would arrive late obviously; the bell went more than half an hour ago! He considered even wagging English since they were just learning about poetry and he wouldn't admit to anyone butâ€¦ he was actually having a go at doing his own poetry and it turned out pretty good
None

There is no way he would admit that to anyone, not even his mum.

None

While Puck almost turned the corner, his thoughts on poetry vanished when he saw somebody beginning to leave the girl's bathroom
None

His exotic eyes widened when he noticed it was Mercedes
None

He hid from behind the corner, his back to the wall, hearing what Mercedes was saying to someone.

None

Girl, are you sure you're going to be okay?

None

I'll be okay, promise
None

You can go without me; I've already done the Science assignment.

None

Puck immediately recognized that voice
None

How could he forget it? That voice made him feel like heaven and hell.

None

Okay, I'll take down some notes incase there are some
None

Don't worry, if I find that guy that did that to you, he'll cry for his momma that's for sure, and with that, Mercedes left the bathroom, pacing in the direction from where Puck was.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Acting all cool, he turned the corner, glancing up at the ceiling with his hands in his jeans pockets, whistling to 'Livin' La Vida Loca', ignoring Mercedes smirk as she turned the corner
None

Knowing fully aware that she was gone and that no one was in the hallway, he precariously entered the dreaded girl's bathroom.

None

The first thing he observed was the smell
None

It smelled so much like vanilla and cream, just like Rachelâ€¦ not like he knew that or anything
None

But the next thing he noted was something he probably wouldn't forget for the rest of his life â€“ Rachel starting to unbutton her shirt.

None

Uh-oh, Puck's dreams are coming true, but to his dismay, her back was facing him, totally oblivious to the fact that someone from the opposite gender or a nightmare to her Puck was in the girl's lavatory.

None

Puck gave a low whistle, feeling all lusty already
None

Damn that Rachel Berry for turning him on!

None

She halted from what she was doing, and turned to stare at the mirror, to her horror seeing the last person she least expected to see in the girl's bathroom
None

She quickly grabbed her unbuttoned shirt and covered herself up, holding onto her sides so the shirt won't slip from her grip.

None

Puck chuckled, loving that she just blushed and was making a complete fool out of herself
None

Damn Berry, you sure know how to make me feel good.

None

Rachel glared at him furiously
None

Get out of here! Do you not know that this is a certain place in the school where privacy is extremely important?

None

Puck just stared at her mocha eyes bluntly
None

Come on, you know you're hot
None

Just flaunt yourself and don't be afraid of what everyone thinks
None

Isn't that what you tell Tina?

None

Rachel was about to retort when his words made her realize he was indeed right
None

Whenever Tina felt shy or embarrassed about how she dressed in her attire, Rachel always assured her that just because she dressed as a Goth didn't mean that she was an outcast
None

And if everyone thought she was an outcast, she would outshine them all for having the courage to be different and unique from everyone else.

None

Rachel smiled at the fact that Puck had said that
None

Then she realized it was 

None

 that had said that
None

We're not talking about Tina, and get out you pervert! she screeched, changing the subject.

None

Puck rolled his eyes, stepping closer to the fuming girl
None

Look, I'm not here being all perverty okay? I came because I wanted to see if you were alright.

None

Liar, Rachel hissed.

None

Puck raised his hands up, showing he was telling the truth
None

I'm serious but if you wantâ€¦ we can go back to when I was coping a feel on your ass, he whispered, winking at her.

None

Rachel pushed him, grabbed her bag that was full of extra clothes and marched to the closest cubicle and locked herself in it
None

Why the hell do you even care if I'm alright or not?

None

Because that asshole threw a slushie at you, and not just any slushie, 

None

 slushie! Puck whined, talking to the closed door that Rachel kept herself in.

None

Who would've thought that Noah Puckerman cared for someone and not just anybody, but the Gleek freak Rachel Berry, he heard her utter.

None

Puck seemed offended with what he had heard her say
None

She tells Tina to just appreciate her own body and not let anybody put her down, and yet she didn't feel that way about herself? Excuse me sunshine, but you are not a Gleek freak
None

You are a sexy Gleek freak.

None

Shut up with those derogatory words you use for me, they show disrespect to me, Rachel said as she entered out of the cubicle, her plain shirt and lime green jumper now replaced with a buttoned up rosy pink shirt

And woo she looked hot in it.

Puck advanced towards her, smirking

Rachel glanced up and his face was inches away
None

She could smell his aftershave â€“ minty with a strong essence of musk.

['smell', 'aftershave', 'with', 'essence']

None

Cut the act, let's just get down and dirty already, Puck announced, wiggling his eyebrows mischieviously.

None

Horrified, Rachel bolted away from the left tackle
None

Pity she wasn't that athletic because since a) Puck is athletic, b) he had quick reflexes and c) have you seen his guns and abs? he grabbed her by the wrist, resulting to her falling back slightly, if it wasn't for Puck who held her by the waist.

None

Puck honey?

None

Yes sexy pie?

None

Eye roll
None

As much as I love our interactions, let go of me.

None

Can't.

None

And why not?

None

Because I'm your knight in shining armour here to protect you from doom and you still have some slushie in your hair.

None

WHAT?!

None

Confused, Rachel and Puck both turned to the entrance of the girl's toilets to see none other than Kurt, his mouth dropped to the ground, horrified
None

Katy says GASP, he randomly stated, tapping the raven velvet hat placed on top of his bouncy hair.

None

Rachel and Puck both glanced at each other, wondering who the hell this Katy chick is
None

They both heard Kurt cooing with joy, clapping his hands with joy and beaming like an idiot.

Finally, a Glee hook-up

I guess you can count Finn and Quinn as a couple, but they are just your typical clichÃ©d teenies, whereas you twoâ€¦ he began with, darting his hazel eyes between the two.

None

Immediately, Rachel pushed Puck away from her, him falling on the ground
None

Unfortunately for her, he seemed to have a good view up her skirt but to his disappointment, she was wearing shorts
None

To his pleasure however, she was wearing denim short shorts
None

Yeowch!

None

We are not together, and we will never be together EVER! Rachel yelled, crossing her arms, pouting.

None

That's not what you said before when you said Puck honey, Puck quoted from the floor
None

Rachel whipped her head to perceive the perve acting like what perves do
None

Agh! You imbecile.

None

What are you doing here anyway homo; this is a girl's bathroom? Puck questioned.

None

Kurt rolled his eyes, annoyed and somewhat offended with what the football player had just said
None

You did not just say that! And by the way, who am I going to talk to about the latest fashion and beauty supplies? Please, I tried that out on Finn and all I got was, Isn't Dove a bird? I mean hello, it's a brand of soap as well! And say whatever you want, you young lovers are just in denial, Kurt responded with
None

He grabbed Katy from his head, putting it close to his ear

Kurt's expression suddenly went to ZOMG

OMG Katy I soo agree with you on that.

Why should I? You're not a mum, but you and I could get pretty cosy if you were one, I meanâ€¦

That's it, leave now you jackass!

None

You let Kurt stay but not your gorgeous, muscled, toned, sexy superhero?

None

Kurt cracked himself, rolling on the floor laughing
None

He slowly got up, bits of laughter coming out of at times
None

Sigh, please you wish you were gorgeous and sexy like me.

None

Are you insulting me you homo? Since you love your face so much, let me have the honour to rearrange that pretty face or yours andâ€¦

None

NOOOOOOOOO! Kurt screamed, fleeing the girl's lavatory, Katy clutched by his side, his voice echoing even though he left
None

You can't touch Katy and you are definitely jealous of my good looks!

None

Please, he is just jealous of my muscles, you didn't hear him mention it, Puck stated, only to realize that Rachel had already left
None

He bolted out of the girl's bathroom, to observe his target heading towards her locker.

None

As she was opening her locker, Puck stood in the lockers next to hers, smirking at her
None

You sneaky minx
None

You have got to stop leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for me to eat, because it will end up to you anyway.

None

Has it ever occurred to you that the whole world doesn't revolve around you?

None

Try telling that to the fashionable Jimmy Coo-Coo.

None

I heard that! Kurt's voice shouted out of no-where, scaring Puck.

None

Okay, that was freaky.

None

Rachel chuckled at Puck's expression
None

She found it cute that one minute he was all flirtatious and the next, he was all scared, something that she was pretty sure not many people had seen before.

None

Admiring my good looks are we? Puck asked, interrupting Rachel's thoughts.

None

Rachel made a 'psshh' sound, rolling her eyes, closing her locker
None

Yes Puck
None

Oh how I want to run my hands all over your torso.

None

Puck grinned, satisfied with her answer
None

We can try that now if you want, and don't worry, I want to do the exact same thing to you too.

None

Dickhead.

None

Aww, your words hurt the heart you know that?

None

If my words are said to you, then I don't really care.

None

Ouch! Hot, feisty but hot.

None

Rachel groaned, running a hand through her chocolate hair, until she remembered that Puck told her she still had some slushie left in her hair
None

Unhurriedly, she pulled her arm back to her side, not wanting the stickiness to go on her hands again.

None

Puck seemed confused
None

Why did you just do that? There is like nothing on your hair.

None

Rachel's eyes widened, glaring murderously at the football player
None

So there is no slushie in my hair?

None

At hearing her question, Puck then realized what she was on about
None

Ohh about thatâ€¦ you see I wanted a reason to hold you.

None

Damn you jerk.

None

What? I was cold and I needed something to keep me warm and you happened to be the answer.

None

Your pick-up lines suck; go try them out on someone else that wants you
None

And with that, Rachel skulked off to her Science class.

Trust me; there is only one person I want, and with that, he headed off towards the Glee room, knowing that the bell would ring any minute now, ending the classes for the day

And the 'psychic' he is, the bell did go off, ending the day.

I mean seriously, how would you react if the guy you hate soo muchâ€¦

None

'More like hate to love,' Mercedes thought to herself, chuckling slightly so her ranting friend wouldn't suspect a thing
None

She was so sick of Rachel blabbing on about what Puck did to Rachel in the girl's bathrooms
None

She suspected he went there, as she did see him walk past him when he was whistling to that shake-your-booty song
None

At least the planned somehow worked, now about the other-

None

â€¦ is on the floor, looking up your skirt and grinning all devilishly, getting all these dirty thoughts popping up in their minds?

None

How could he do that? What a-

None

Asshole, jerk, imbecile, idiot, pervert-

None

Sexy, gorgeous, muscled, toned, hunky, badass he is isn't he? Kurt said from out of no-where.

None

Rachel was appalled with what Kurt had just said
None

Kurt! How could you say that about Puck?

None

Kurt was talking all lovey dovey with Katy until he heard Rachel's words
None

He too was shocked
None

As if I would say that about him! Please, I was talking about someone else thank you very much.

None

Mercedes and Rachel both enquired in unison, Who?

None

Kurt sighed with annoyance with their question
annoyance has no Synonyms in the API
['sigh', 'with', 'annoyance']

Aslan, duh! He is after all 'the king of the jungle.'

None

Oh thank God, can you imagine if you actually said that about Puck? Rachel laughed, while Mercedes and Kurt both looked at each other, a smirk riding up on their face.

None

All of a sudden, someone covered Rachel's mouth, preventing her from screaming, and covering their eyes with a cloth
cloth has no Synonyms in the API
['cover', 'eye', 'with', 'cloth']

With her kicking and screaming, two more people had to drag her, stopping her kicking and struggling to break free
None

They successfully managed to bring her to a small room, opening the door and shoving her in their, hoping she would fall on top of something
None

Noting that she did, they all smirked, closed the door shut, and locked her in their.

None

The three of them headed to where Kurt and Mercedes were standing, both with their mouths dropped to the floorâ€¦ literally.

mouth has no Synonyms in the API
['head', 'with', 'mouth']

And Pucky poo, that is for bashing me up in the boy's germy room for slushing Rachel, Kurt shouted in the direction of the closed door.

None

Awesome! Mercedes squealed, high-fiving them.

None

Kurt noticed that one of them was bleeding
None

OMG you're bleeding, cover it up! Katy doesn't like to see blood, it makes her go all squirmy, he declared, clutching Katy to his chest.

None

Before any of them could say anything, Kurt shooed them away
None

Vite, vite, vite, I don't want my baby to faint in my arms, sweat on my arms would ruin my scented lotion.

None

One of the boys spoke, confused
None

It's not even alive.

None

Gasp, you did not just say that! Kurt stormed off to the Glee room, while Mercedes followed, but before thanking the trio.

None

As Kurt and Mercedes entered the Glee room, Quinn, Santana, Brittany, Artie and Tina all glanced at them, giving them a certain look
None

Kurt and Mercedes' response â€“

None

Excellent, Kurt whispered menacingly, doing his hands in a Mr
None

Burns-esque style.

None

Yes! The girls and Artie cheered, high fiving each other
None

Mr
None

Schue entered, placing his sheets of paper on top of the piano, noticing that his lead female star, and the football players â€“ minus Kurt â€“ was missing.

None

As if they had heard what he was thinking, Finn, Mike and Matt entered the room, ambling quickly towards their seats
None

As Finn sat down next to his pregnant girlfriend, she noticed that her boyfriend was limping a little
None

What happened to you?

None

Finn glanced at Matt and Mike, then at Kurt and Mercedes, smirking
None

Oh thisâ€¦ nothing.

None

Noting Finn's smirk and the way he had said it, Quinn understood what he meant
None

Yeah, they began making out again.

None

Geez, must I say it again? Mike called out from behind the kissing couple.

None

Shut up Mike, Finn shouted, continuing his session with Quinn.

None

Mr
None

Schue counted everyone present except for the punctual Rachel Berry and the bad boy Noah Puckerman
None

How oddâ€¦ or so he thought.

None

Guys, where is Rachel and Puck?

None

From hearing what Mr
None

Schue had just said, everyone, even the teacher himself laughed their butts off
None

Kurt held a handheld mirror grasped firmly on his hand and played with Katy, adjusting it on his head at the same time

He glanced up to Mr
None

Schue, his eyes twinkling with evilness

When they both wake up and see the state of their 'living conditions' and the size of the room, they are going to need protection, and yes I meant

Rachel gasped a little, waking up
None

Why the hell did she just have a dream about before? Out of all the things she could dream of, 

None

 had to be in it
None

To her, it sucked big time
None

The guy who would piss her off, give her flirtatious comments, and sometimes insult her dignity and pride had to be in her dreams
None

In a way, she was grateful he wasn't involved in one of her dreams that was R18+ ratedâ€¦ not that she had dreams like thatâ€¦ awkward silence right now.

None

Shivering slightly since she didn't bring a spare jumper after being slushied, she scanned her surroundings for her blanket
None

Oddly, she couldn't find it so she mentally decided to grab the first thing she perceived in the dark â€“ a jacket
None

Rachel carefully grabbed it where it lay near her legs and wrapped it around her slender body, warmth from the silky article of clothing immediately making her body regenerating heat
None

She moved her way closer to the warm pillow that made her feel comfortable, and nestled her head on it gently
None

A smile spread across her plump lips, shutting her mocha eyes and slowly drifting off to sleep.

None



None



None



None



None

Today was such a long and tiring day, especially for her having to deal with a pervert, asshole, idiot, flirtatious imbecile, badass, juvenile freak â€“ all the same person
pervert has no Synonyms in the API
['deal', 'with', 'pervert']

Rachel was just glad she was safe in her room, and that nothing can annoy her now
None

She sighed heavily, snuggling deeper, her somewhat firm but gentle pillow relaxing her head, and tugging on the jacket to have minimum goosebumps.

None

Somehow, she felt something snake around her hips, causing Rachel to open her eyes, scared
None

Precariously, she turned her head, ready to scream when she saw it was none other than an arm
None

This literally freaked Rachel out, finding out that someone had smuggled a dead body in McKinley High, let alone she was resting her head on top of one.

None

Cue a muffled scream.

None

That was until she saw whose arm it belonged to, staring at their visage, her worst nightmare herself: Noah Puckerman
None

She gasped, covering her mouth so he wouldn't wake up
None

Unfortunately for her, he slowly began to open his gorgeous eyes, his vision blurry
None

After a while, it registered on the first thing he saw â€“ that annoying hell of a diva Rachel Berryâ€¦ whose head was lying gracefully on his chest.

None

The part our favourite bad boy loved the most â€“ she was now in a position that was very, very suggestive, something he couldn't get out of his head
None

Bad Puck, bad, get those dirty thoughts out of your head.

None

A smirk grew on his face
None

Well, looks like little miss sexy has entered the dark side.

None

Rachel began to protest, but it just gave Puck the opportunity to wrap his arm around Rachel's waist even more
None

She tried to push herself off of him, but it just made her now lie on top of him
None

As much as Rachel was horrified about the outcome, Puck was enjoying every minute of it
None

If this was what heaven was like, he wanted it to be like that forever.

None

Didn't know you wanted to take it to the next level, I mean if you want we can skip first base and go straight to second, or if you really can't resist my manliness, let's just jump to home already
None

What do you say about that?

None

I'd say you're a complete jackass and a buffoon for even suggesting that.

None

Oh come on! You know you want too.

None

Keep telling yourself that.

None

I do, don't you worry about that
None

And I know you do, you keep looking at my handsome face and admire my special qualities and abilities.

None

Like slushing people? Retorting unnecessary comments and derogatory words? Picking on people that have a lower status than you on the social ladder?

None

What? I am not like that, and I was referring to my pecks, my abs, and don't get me started on my guns!

None

Nice, but I don't care! And that's not what I'm looking for in my perfect man.

None

Whatever it is, I'm all of it, except for prissy â€“ that's you.

None

You know what Puck? Screw you!

None

You know what? That ain't a bad idea, how about it?

None

AGHHH!

None

Meanwhileâ€¦

None

Glee rehearsal had just finished, and the Glee gang was laughing at Finn's perspective on throwing Rachel in the little room
None

They all halted when they heard arguing in the room itself.

None

You know what Puck? Screw you!

None

You know what? That ain't a bad idea, how about it?

None

AGHHH!

None

The gang tried to laugh, but contained themselves to muffled chuckling
None

Kurt smiled, placing his hand across his heart while tapping Katy that lay blandly on his mop of luscious hair
None

Sigh, young love
None

Always in denial, but not for long
None

He grabbed Katy from his head and started making googly eye expressions with it, puckering his lips to the object clutched in his hand.

Guys, I think I'm ready to take my relationship with Katy to the next level, Kurt announced, but quietly since he didn't want the bickering couple locked up in the room to stop, wellâ€¦ bickering.

None

Brittany awed, Mercedes, Artie and Tina looked at him like he was stupid, and the rest all gave him a clueless expression
None

Uhâ€¦ who is Katy? Finn questioned, brave enough to break the eerie silence â€“ apart from the banters fromâ€¦ must I say who?

None

Kurt gasped, his eyes filled with anger
anger has no Synonyms in the API
None

Gasp, you did not just say that? Did he just say that? he asked his fellow Glee members, who in return just nodded their heads, except for Brittany who shouted, Repeat what you said Finn.

None

How can you not know who Katy is, we've been the most talked about couple since we hooked up! he shouted, raising his oh so cute voice a little.

None

But you supposedly 'hooked up' just today, Artie interjected, emphasizing his words.

None

Stop it Artie, not only are you insulting me, you're also insulting my dear Katy, Kurt explained annoyed
None

He held Katy in front of the paraplegic wheelchair user's visage, his expression smug
None

Apologize.

None

Artie got confused
None

What?

None

Mercedes cut in
None

Kurt, it's just a stupid hat
None

Besides, you're gonna leave it for another item of clothing anyway.

None

Kurt did that 'nu-uh' thing with his finger in front of his sassy friend
None

Nu-uh, and by the way, Katy is 

None

 stupid; 

None

 stupid for suggesting that
None

I've never had this connection with any of my belongings before
None

She shares the same pain as me and you are all just jealous that 

None

 is going stronger than PuckleBerry.

None

Quinn glanced at him stupidly
None

You actually gave yourself one of those hook-up names used on celebrities?

None

Finn nodded with his pregnant girlfriend

['nod', 'with', 'girlfriend']

Yeah, and what's PuckleBerry? Is that a fruit?

None

Groans came out from everyone, who all left the still confused Finn
None

What did I say?

None

Quinn came back for her boyfriend, pulling him by his ear while he complained about the pain
None

No wonder why you failed English.

None

Puck gushed like a lovesick fool when Rachel scrunched her nose with disgust, hidden freckles popping out on her visage
disgust has no Synonyms in the API
None

If only she knew how cute she just looked right now.

None

You are on my death wish Noah Puckerman, Rachel threatened, interrupting his sudden sappy thoughts evaporating from thin air.

None

Puck leaned closer to her ear, chuckling
None

Is that so? And by the way, nice jacket.

None

Rachel glanced to where her jacket lay wrapped around her legs, gasping in horror
None

It wasn't her jacket, it was 

None

 jersey jacket
None

Oh crap, no
None

She reached out for the jacket, and chucked it at his face.

None

Puck mumbled into the jacket
None

Wow, Berry's legs were wrapped around my jacket and I didn't even persuade her to do it
None

The guys now owe me ten bucks.

None

That was when Rachel noticed her surroundings
None

She wasn't in her room, why would her room have several types of brooms and buckets, have a lot of dirt everywhere, and not have a bed? There was only one place she could think of that she and Puck were inâ€¦

None

Oh shit! she cursed, getting off of Puck to open the door
None

What do you know? It's locked
None

Panicking, Rachel banged on the door, demanding someone to open it right now.

None

However, Puck didn't understand her motives
None

Berry, I don't really know what you are doing, but just sit your ass down next to me right now, he exclaimed, patting the empty space next to him.

None

Rachel just ignored him and kept yelling
None

Puck rolled his eyes, got up, flexed his muscles a bit, and trudged towards the screaming petite girl banging furiously at the hollow door
None

Step aside darling, let a real man show you how it's done.

None

He gently shoved Rachel to the side, and kicked the door
None

The kick was so loud that the door would openâ€¦ but it didn't
None

Annoyed, Puck kicked the door a few more times, banging himself to it, even chucking a few buckets at it
None

No movement from the door whatsoever.

None

Puck groaned, rubbing his muscles
None

Ow, my poor guns are now deflated.

None

Rachel rolled her eyes
None

How egotistical of you, and what a great way to show what a real man you really are
None

She had to admit that when he gently moved her from the enclosed door, her goosebumps resurfaced and it wasn't because she was wearing a shirt and skirt, and when he hurled himself towards the door, a part of her somehow made her feel the same pain he did.

None

Puck glanced up to the girl trapped with him, annoyed
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Well you go try doing that then.

None

I don't want to act like a total Neanderthal, that's more of your job, she answered, crossing her arms across her chest, huffing.

None

You got one part right â€“ I 

None

 wild, he stated, winking at her
None

His face then turned serious
None

Why were you banging like a psycho girl that seemed drunk and had some drugs?

None

Rachel scoffed
None

Firstly, I have morals to obtain, and drugs and alcohol are not one of them
None

Secondly, I'm not a psycho, and thirdly, don't you know what room we are in now?

None

Puck stared at anywhere but the girl in front of him
None

When she finished her speech, he sneered at her
None

Oh, you done? Good and all I know is that I'm in a room 

None

.

None

After he had said that, Rachel's cheeks started to burn up
None

One, the last few words he had just said to her, 

None

 made her feel queasy in her stomach 

None

 her heart, and two; his face was only a few inches apart
None

Puck seemed to realize this as well as he noticed in the dark that Rachel moved her head to the side
None

Puck seemed to smile at that â€“ it turned out all the girls couldn't resist him, even the wannabe diva herself.

None

Incase you have failed to notice, we are both locked in the 

None

! Rachel whispered angrily.

None

Puck glanced at Rachel oddly
None

And you are angry about this why?

None

Rachel gave a quiet shrill, raising her hands up in the air
None

Because I'm stuck with you!

None

You say it like it's a bad thing.

None

Uhâ€¦ because it is!

None

Nothing had change after being locked in the dreaded janitor's closet with their worst nightmare for over three and a half hours
nightmare has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel was still banging on the hollow door, yelling for anyone to let them out, while Puck lazily just sat on the ground, listening to his iPod and watching Rachel making a complete fool out of herself in the dark
None

To be honest, Puck actually had dreams like these â€“ when he and Rachel were stuck in a predicament and in the end, they would be making out like there was no tomorrow
None

Oh how he loved those dreams so much, it made him feel what all teenaged boys feel in their adolescent stage
None

You can figure it out yourselves if you know what I meanâ€¦

None

Puck stopped fantasizing when he heard no more banging from the darling herself
None

He perceived Rachel leaning on the door, wrapping her arms around her legs, and whimpering to herself
None

Even though it was still dark, he noticed she was wiping a few tears off of her rosy cheeks
None

Sighing, he stood up and walked over to her, careful not to trip over anything, since they still hadn't found the light switch yet.

None

Rachel peeked up, seeing the mohawked boy towering over her
None

What do you want now? Come to laugh at this situation, or say more endearments to me?

None

Puck seemed stung by her words
None

Sure, he loved pushing her buttons but deep down he was someone with feelings
None

He sat next to the teary-eyed girl and motioned for a hug
None

Rachel looked at him as if he was on fire
None

What are you doing?

None

I'm cold, Puck stated while smirking, his voice whining a little
None

How could he not turn down this opportunity to make more fun of her?

None

Go grab your jacket, Rachel hissed quietly, rubbing her arms.

None

It's too far to get it, Puck whined even more.

None

Rachel stared at him like he was stupid
None

It's an arm's length away.

None

Puck retorted
None

But it's too far!

None

You keep saying you're a man, now prove it.

None

I'll show you how manly I am if I can get into your pants.

None

You disgusting creep of a human being.

None

But I'm 

None

 disgusting creep of a human being.

None

Puck, shut up for once in your life.

None

No can do Berry
None

You would miss all the hot 'endearments' I say to you and you will definitely miss my sexy voice.

None

Rachel sighed
None

There was no point arguing with Puck, she was going to die with him anyway
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['argue', 'with', 'puck']

We're going to die
None

I'm never going to be well-known and live the glamorous life, and you won't live to take care of your child.

None

This caught Puck off guard
None

How did he know about the whole pregnancy thing with Quinn?

None

I don't know what you are talking about, Puck immediately responded with, looking away from Rachel.

None

I know about the situation that you and Quinn are in, and I know that she is pregnant, and the baby is yours
None

You can deny all you want, I know that you know that I'm right, Rachel explained with more detail.

detail has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck sighed, for once no comebacks or flirtatious comments running through his skull
None

Who told you this?

None

One response from Rachel answered everything
None

Mercedes.

None

Damn bitch can't keep her mouth shut, Puck mumbled, shifting his position slightly on the closet floor.

None

Mercedes may be a loud mouth at times, but she is a good friend
None

She is always there for me, and I'll always be there for her
None

And I know that if she saw that kid that slushied me, she would eat him alive, and Kurt would be there to bitch-slap the guy, she remarked, wrapping her arms around herself.

None

That loser has already been taken care of, Puck mumbled, cracking his knuckles
None

This got Rachel to glance at him coyly and concerned
None

What did you just say?

None

Karma will hit him that's for sure, Puck stated, changing his words
None

To be truthful, he didn't want Rachel to know that after she was slushied in front of the entire student body and after she ran away, he had beat up that asshole
None

Like he told himself before, he needed to be her knight in shining armour, since she was vulnerable at the school, but he wanted to be hidden, like a dark knight or something
None

Actually, he liked that more than being the 'knight in shining armour' â€“ it made him look like a punce, and Noah Puckerman was not a punce.

None

Who was it? Rachel suddenly enquired.

None

He turned to face her
None

What now?

None

Who was it thatâ€¦ you know, threw theâ€¦ Rachel began to say, hoping Puck knew what she was referring to.

None

Puck didn't know who it was actually
None

In fact, did the guy even go to their school? Some guy wearing some really big shades, wearing a jersey jacket and some old hat grandparents would wear, Puck remembered
None

Oh how he wanted to beat up the guy againâ€¦ he wondered what ever happened to him after.

None

Rachel sighed
None

It doesn't even matter who the guy was, I'm pretty sure you found it more amusing.

None

Puck looked at her oddly and unsure
None

What do you mean?

None

You would actually ask that question? You should know the answer by now; I mean you always throw a slushie in my face anyway, so I should've known that it was you who planned the whole thing, she explained even more.

None

Puck got angry that he was accused of something he didn't do
None

You think I planned this? Are you nuts or something?

None

It's your area of expertise and you always love throwing slushies in my face.

None

If this is my area of expertise, then I would've slushied you myself.

None

Why didn't you then?

None

'Cause a) the dweeb did it for me, and b) I happen to be a human being with emotional feelings like everyone in the world.

feeling has no Synonyms in the API
None

You really? Boy, I wouldn't have guessed that.

None

Puck smirked a little on the petite girl sitting next to him, who was shivering slightly
None

His smirk faded slightly, feeling sympathetic for the girl
None

If only there was something he could do to make her â€“ for once, instead of all the quarrels â€“ smile, and really mean it
None

Shuffling a little, he reached for his jersey jacket and handed it to Rachel
None

Her eyes widened, wondering what the bad boy was up to, so she raised one eyebrow to question his actions.

None

Puck chuckled
None

Relax darling, I did what you told me to do â€“ grab my jacket
None

And because I'm a good Samaritan and all, I gave it to you
None

Now what do you say to your hero? he turned his face to the side, so Rachel was facing his right cheek.

None

Rachel chucked back the jacket to Puck's face, the jacket literally covering his visage
None

Good Samaritan my ass.

None

Puck took the jacket off his face, smirking
None

Would you prefer my jacket or my hugs? Well, I wouldn't care what you pick because either way, it would involve me so I don't mind
None

Although if I was you, I would definitely pick the second option, because-

None

Immediately, Rachel took his jacket from him, resulting to Puck smirking his butt off
None

Knew you couldn't resist me, even if you chose my jacket over me, but don't worry, you will come crawling to me anyway
None

They all do.

None

Rachel slipped on the jacket, glad her arms were rapidly warm
None

There was a problem though â€“ it looked like a beanbag was thrown over her
None

She wondered if Puck noticed this too
None

Unfortunately for her, he did, because now he was laughing his ass off.

None

Noah Puckerman, shut the

 up!

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Rewind, rewind all the wayâ€¦ and pause

Ha ha, very funny, now shut up before I make you.

None

That's okay; I'm ready to have a make-out session anyway
None

Who starts, me or you?

None

You barnacle head.

None

Puck chuckled and stood up, pacing back to where he woke up before, and sat back down, positioning himself and beginning to relax
None

He placed his hands at the back of his mohawked head, fingers intertwined, staring at the dim window light at the top of the wall opposite him
None

Even with the light from the window, it still wasn't bright enough to find the light switchâ€¦ did the janitor's closet even have a light switch?

['be', 'with', 'light']

Since Puck had moved away from her, Rachel's warmth had died down, and felt colder than before
None

She tried huddling her knees, wrapping her arms around her legs while trying to cover both her slender legs and arms with the jersey jacket
jacket has no Synonyms in the API
['cover', 'leg', 'with', 'jacket']

Puck perceived this, and took this as an advantage to piss her off even more
None

Still cold honey bunny?

None

Rachel stared at him from the opposite side of the janitor's closet
None

Something you can't fix.

None

Sure I can, come sit here, Puck motioned
None

Pity, he was motioning to hisâ€¦

None

Rachel scrunched her nose with disgust, and scoffed
disgust has no Synonyms in the API
None

Eww! I will not sit on your lap!

None

Well, I know you don't like to get your clothes dirty and such, so I wouldn't recommend sitting on the ground, but then how will you sleep, like a zombie? Please, knowing you, you'd be like the K-man and needs their beauty sleep, Puck stated, his eyes still focused on the dim light.

None

I can manage thanks, she concluded, resting her head on the door to attempt to sleep.

None

Fine, have it your way, Puck uttered, his eyelids closed.

None

For thirty minutes, Rachel tried to sleep, but it was hopeless
None

She was so darn cold, and she didn't want her clothing to get too dirty
None

She wasn't a germ freak like Miss
None

Pillsbury but she didn't want germs and bacteria and all to crawl all over her in the middle of the night, since this 

None

 the janitor's closet
None

She glanced at where Puck was, sitting in the same position, his hands still; intertwined resting at the back of his partially bald head
None

That was when his offer immediately popped up in her mind.

None

No fricking way would she do it
None

She had some morals to obtain, and if she was famous, it would be a scandal if everyone found out she was sleeping on some juvenile idiot's lap
None

However, she felt like she had no choice anyway
None

Precariously, she got up, tiptoeing her way to the sleeping rebel
None

When she reached him, she unhurriedly sat on his lap, making sure that her skirt covered up her mid-thigh area so he wouldn't get any dirty and erotic ideas
None

Knowing him, she begged to differ.

None

Instantly, her legs, as well as her arms were warm once again
None

She smiled that she could finally sleep in peace, and the fact that she didn't wake him
None

Rachel nestled her head on Puck's chest, his breathing in an even pace, making her feel more sleepy
None

Closing her eyelids, she quietly sighed, feeling relaxed and glad that warmth had regenerated into her body once again.

None

Poor thing however didn't know that Puck opened one eye, smirking at Rachel's final decision to sit on his lap
None

Since their conversation ended half an hour ago, he was awake the whole time, but he kept hearing Rachel moving about uncomfortably, and he vowed to himself that he wouldn't sleep until she fell asleep peacefully
None

Now that she was comfortable enough, he could finally dream
None

He wished somehow that everyone knew that Rachel Berry was sitting and sleeping happily on his lap, if only his phone didn't die out on him before
None

Oh well, at least he could always dream about the incident over and over again.

None

Pity, the whole time she and Puck were trapped inside, they didn't seem to notice a camera, flashing red repeatedly, zooming in on the two because a) who would've thought that the bad boy and the good girl that hated each other so much would be stuck in a sticky situation where they were very much 

None

 to each other, and b) the conversation between the two was still going, even if it was a quick one.

None

Knew you couldn't resist me.

None

I thought you were asleep?

None

Couldn't, because of your shuffling
None

Why you were shuffling? You missed my warmth and wanted to get close to me as possible, that's why.

None

Puck, shut up, I'm too tired
None

Goodnight.

None

Night cherry Berry.

None

Shut it.

None

You love it.

None

Oh I would love itâ€¦ love it for you to shush! I'm trying to be comfortable.

None

On my lap, remember? And to think you could be moving about in that corner on the floor, freezing to death, and I gave you an offer and you turn it down and what's this? You're on my lap! See, like I said before, I'm such a good Samaritan.

None

And like I said before, Good Samaritan my ass.

None



None

A click of a button occurred, gasps filling the room
None

Uttered silence untilâ€¦ REWIND PRONTO!

None

Next thing to happen, the same voices filled the Glee room, the same voices that really needed to see that beyond their exterior they both wanted each other badly, the same voices that were locked up in the janitor's closet
None

In a way, they sort of deserved to be locked in that dreaded room, they just needed to shut up.

None



None



None

Another click of a button occurred yet again, more awkward silences, this one seemed to be much longer than the first, until yet the same voice boomed aloud, Repeat s'il vous plaÃ®t! And once again, the same voices were repeated again and again and again.

None

And once again, the same person who happened to be the fashionista wanted it to be heard again
None

After seventeen times being repeated, someone took the remote from Kurt's hands and threw it at the musical posters on the wall
None

The New Directions clan turned to perceive who would do something pretty stupidiotic like that.

None

Hey, I was watching that! Kurt blasted at the person who threw the one device that controlled and showed how much chemistry Puck and Rachel really had going on in the janitor's closet.

None

Sorry Kurt, but Matt said that you were playing with a bomb and that it would explode any minute, Brittany apologetically said to a now furious Kurt.

bomb has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'bomb']

And you actually believed him? Kurt questioned to the Cheerio cheerleader.

None

I didn't think she would actually do it, but it was funny, Matt articulated in his defence, crossing his arms across his jersey, snickering
None

Someone nudged him on the head, making him topple over towards the ground.

None

That's my girl you're talking about, Mike shouted to Matt.

None

Sorry man, Matt apologized to his buddy and Brittany.

None

Mike helped up his friend from the ground
None

I forgive you man.

None

Man, stop saying man! Kurt shrilled, causing Katy to fall off from on top of his mop of hair
None

Kurt gasped, picking up his love from the floor, dusting it with all his might

None

Quick, does someone know CPR?

None

Kurt, it's just a stupid hat, Mercedes told her friend, annoyed at him.

None

FYI, Katy isn't just a hat
None

And she isn't stupid, she has sensitive hearing, Kurt whispered, darting his eyes back and forth.

None

Mercedes turned to her fellow Glee club members, questioning the same look that got everyone wondering
None



None

Anyways moving on
None

Who wants to watch it again? Quinn perked up, breaking the awkward silence.

None

Everyone's hand went up, while Kurt raised both of his hands
None

Confused, Quinn asked the boy, Why are you putting up two hands?

None

Kurt sighed
None

Because I want to watch it, and Katy wants to watch it too, he said in a monotonous tone, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

None

Guys, you've been watching the whole thing three times already, Mr
None

Schue proclaimed, annoyed that his students were ignoring their rehearsing time to go watch what Puck and Rachel were doing in that enclosed room
None

Sure, Mr
None

Schue knew that the kids had locked them up, I mean he was the one that suggested locking them there in the first place, but he didn't think that they were all obsessed with what they were doing every second
None

There wasn't much to see anyway because they were still sleeping, Rachel leaning her head on Puck's chest, while Puck held onto her protectively.

None

Mr
None

Schue was just glad the bell went, commencing another brand new day, and also glad that he didn't have to watch his Glee kids rewinding to Puck and Rachel's conversations in the closet
None

Now that he thought about it, where did he put the key for the janitor's closet?

None



None

OMG shut up, rewind and pause
None

Rachel kissing Puck?

None

Immediately, Rachel fidgeted a little, waking up slowly
None

It took the diva a while to figure out that it wasn't real, it was just a dream
None

As if she would ever kiss a football player, let alone Puck
None

Back then, she wished it was Finn, but now she somehow lost interest in him
None

She had some morals to obtain, and that also included avoiding herself away from someone that was juvenile like Puck
None

Unfortunately for her, he kept invading that boundary of hers.

None

Something was holding her around the waist, but Rachel ignored it and snuggled her head deeper into her 'pillow'
None

A sudden thought came to her mind â€“ 

None

She placed her hand on it, touching it in a few places, even gently squeezing certain parts
None

She could've sworn she heard something beating that wasn't her heart
None

That was when she heard a groan that definitely did not sound like her at all
None

Her waist was now held tighter than before, as well as feeling something wrapped around them
None

She glanced down to see a pair of arms wrapped around her hips, fingers intertwined with each other
other has no Synonyms in the API
None

Only one thought was present in her mind.

None

Rachel heard a small chuckle from above her, and glanced in that direction
None

Too late, she was now staring at the blinking eyes of Puck, which seemed to have a mysterious glint in them
None

Morning sunshine, he announced, smirking deviously at her.

None

Then Rachel remembered everything that had happened yesterday
None

She remembered Mr
None

Schuester assigning her to do a mash-up with Puck, her being slushied by someone in front of Puck, a perverted Puck chatting her up in the girl's bathroom, her being locked up in the janitor's closet with Puck..

['do', 'up', 'with', 'puck']

why did Puck have to be involved with everything that included her? Was this fate or just really bad karma?

everything has no Synonyms in the API
None

Is someone thinking hard about me, or is it something really dirty and scandalous? Puck questioned, wiggling his eyebrows mischieviously.

None

Rachel glared at the boy staring back at her
None

As if I would think of a jackass like you, and I have some morals to obtain
None

I'm not a perverted buff like you
None

Rachel crossed her arms, looking towards the dim light from the window on top of the closet.

None

But I'm your perverted buff, Puck expressed, sneering
None

His face changed to an expression that looked like he was actually thinking
None

Pity, it was an egotistical comment
None

Did you just say that I'm buff?

None

Rachel's chocolate eyes widened, realising that she indeed say that he was buff
None

She bowed her head down, her cheeks warming up
None

Puck noticed this and smirked his butt off, seeking a brand new opportunity to mess with his favourite wannabe diva.

You soo have the hots for me.

None

Please, you wish I did.

None

Don't lie to me babe
None

You and I both know it's true
None

You want this man candy.

None

You know what? You're right Puck.

None

Of course I am right..
None

wait, what? Puck couldn't believe what he was hearing
None

He was just trying to mess with her, but he didn't expect to hear a confession from her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

A confession which proved what he was trying to get out from her ever since the beginning of high school.

None

Rachel smirked deviously, gazing admiringly at the football player
None

You heard me Puck, I want you
None

I want you soo bad..., she stated seductively, giving him a flirty wink.

None

Puck liked this very much indeed, wanting to hear the following words from her luscious lips again and again
None

Heck, he didn't want it to end
None

Damn Rachel Berry for making him all lusty over three words
None

She wrapped her arms around his neck, huddling comfortably in his lap, while all Puck could do was get hornier that normal
None

He didn't think he could control himself any longer.

None

Rachel then placed both of her hands on each side of his face, lifting Puck's visage lower so they were both eye level with each other
None

Leaning her face closer so they were only a few inches apart, she repeated her words again
None

I want you Puck...

None

Puck was expecting a kiss but he didn't expect what was coming next.

None

...to get your arms off of me! And with that, SLAP went her hand with his face, and a whine came from Puck's mouth.

With Puck touching the sting from where Rachel had slapped him, Rachel was free from Puck's grasp and immediately banged on the door to let her out

After five minutes of calling out for help, the only response she got was the agonizing whimpers from the boy behind her.

None

Ow! You hit like a girl! Puck whined, half of his face the colour of a tomato.

None

Rachel turned around to face him before continuing with her cries for help
cry has no Synonyms in the API
None

And what do you think I am?

None

A feisty girl
None

I like that, Puck said, in between from rubbing his face from the pain.

None

Stop sooking like a baby, get up and help us find a way to be free from this place, Rachel affirmed.

None

Puck shook his head
None

But I like this place
None

We're alone, in a room, hinting we should be making out right now, and no one is watching.

None

Little did he know.

I never ever want to suck face with beings like you.

And what would Plan B be?

 thing...

None

OMG Noah Puckerman, you are a disgusting, vile, cruel-hearted man to ever walk on this planet! You and your pick-up lines can go take a hike!

Only if you come with me I will.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

One more of those flirt lines and I swear to God I will cut your balls and throw it in the shredding machine to be shredded.

None

Before Puck could add a sly remark, he shut his mouth when he saw that Rachel was giving him a death glare, her chocolate eyes full of scarlet
None

She was pretty much dead serious about her statement, and with her fired up made her seem like Satan
None

Add a red devil suit and devil horns and it would make her seem like a 

None

 Satan..
None

bad thoughts, bad thoughts Puck, get them out of your head.

None

Hearing no comeback, Rachel beamed at him, proud that she stood up to him and he just stood there speechless
None

Even though yesterday had started out as a rough patch, maybe Rachel's luck turned around for the better
None

Maybe all the bad karma involving her was changing in a brighter perspective.

None

Her thoughts were interrupted by Puck saying a sentence that made all her hopes vanish completely
None

You soo would love the way my balls feel like anyway.

None

Rachel groaned, frustrated
None

Or maybe the bad karma was just finding a way to bite deeper into her ass.

None

Little did the two of them know...

None

It was lunchtime, and the cafeteria was packed
None

Mercedes, Tina and Artie were queuing in the line to grab some food
None

Since it would probably take them until the end of time to actually be served, they were discussing their favourite topic and its current issue.

None

Sh-should we l-l-let th-them out?

None

Heck no! I haven't laughed this hard in forever since watching Rush Hour on TV.

None

Uh, Mercedes..
None

that was on last Saturday.

None

I know, but this is some funny stuff we have on PuckleBerry
None

Can you believe the audio that we have on them from last week reached more than a million hits on YouTube?

None

And can you believe our PuckleBerry group in Facebook has more than seventy-two-thousand members, and we only made the group only last Thursday?

None

Th-th-that i-is amaz-z-zing!

None

The trio made it to the front of the line, grabbed three trays and packed almost the entire food selection that was available, and more than three boxes of buttery popcorn
None

The lunch ladies all looked disgusted, wondering why three teenagers would want to eat almost the whole food supply
None

Mercedes smiled at the lunch lady, immediately stuffing herself with popcorn
popcorn has no Synonyms in the API
['stuff', '-PRON-', 'with', 'popcorn']

Quinn, she stated, the one word that seemed to solve any unanswered questions
None

And you know how hormones drive pregnant women crazy.

None

Before the lunch lady could respond, Mercedes grabbed two trays and ran, with Tina pushing Artie in his wheelchair and him holding the rest of the food supply behind her, bursting out of the cafeteria like mad men
None

They stopped at a corner, and pissed themselves laughing, pacing their way towards the Glee room.

None

Hell yeah! Fly me some fingers baby!

None

We sh-sh-should d-def-defin-defintely put the vi-video of th-them in the cl-closet in You-YouTube as well.

None

Tina, shut up! We should? We 

None

 do that!

None

Do what?

None

The trio stood frozen and stared at the person who said those words that could possibly ruin everything
None

They sighed with relief when they saw it was none other than Finn who said those words.

relief has no Synonyms in the API
['sigh', 'with', 'relief']

Post the vid to YouTube, Artie responded for the trio.

None

That would be grouse, Brittany chirped up from behind Finn, grabbing the trays of food from Artie and Mercedes
None

She then stood frozen, thinking for a moment
None

Or gross
None

Is it grouse or gross?

None

Peoples, shouted Kurt, who was happily nibbling on some popcorn from Katy
None

Don't mean to interrupt your tea party or anything like that, but I would like all of you to move your rears so we can watch the movie!

None

They obliged, and as soon as everyone had some item of food â€“ Quinn had more food than the rest like Mercedes said, ...hormones drive pregnant women crazy, â€“ they sat back, munched down on their glorious 'healthy' and 'nutritional' lunch and watched what had gone down in the janitor's closet while they had classes to attend to.

None

Lucky for the New Directions clan, there was a spare remote for the TV so once again, Kurt rewinded to the hilarious parts of the video, and once again Matt was tempted to make Brittany make a fool out of herself by this time telling her that Kurt was holding a 

None

 poisonous snake instead of a bomb
None

They all thought that nothing could ruin their lunchtime or the sexual chemistry and banters between the two polar opposites.

None

Little did they know...

None

Damnit, where the hell did I put it?

None

While the Glee kids were watching Rachel and Puck in the janitor's closet with amusement, Mr
None

Schue had other problems to deal with
None

His problems weren't that important but the main predicament kept nagging him in his mind
None

What was this problem of his? Where he put the key for the janitor's closet.

None

It may have been his idea to lock them there in the first place, but Mr
None

Schue knew that if they didn't get out sooner or later..
None

it's not best to say
None

It just would be another sticky situation that would defiantly involve him
None

Rummaging through his desk drawers, Mr
None

Schue was panicking big time
None

He didn't want his kids to be locked up in that room forever, no matter how much time they need to work out their differences
None

Focused on finding that one small brassy object was his main desire that he didn't even feel the touch of someone tapping him on the shoulder, until...

None

Will?

None

Mummy! he shrieked, raising his hands up in the air in a surrender fashion, with sheets of paper floating all over his office
sheet has no Synonyms in the API
['raise', 'hand', 'with', 'sheet']

He raised his eyes when he realised 

None

 was in the exact same room with him.

None



None

Mr
None

Schue groaned inwardly, and tried not to yawn at Sue Sylvester's face
None

I know that I may be old and still looking pretty damn sexy, but your mother? No offence Will but that's just pretty messed up.

None

What do you want Sue? Mr
None

Schue didn't have time for this
None

Out of all the people in the school, he wished he locked up Sue in the janitor's closet instead of Puck and Rachel
None

It would actually give him a reason to smile whenever he thought of Sue, all locked up in some small, dirty, murky, dark closet.

None

Oh nothing, just wanted to come by and talk about our 

None

 of ours.

None

Crap, how could he forget about that?

None

If you're trying to make me give you the setlist for sectionals, then you're wrong-

None

Not that you bumhead
None

Although that is actually smart, why didn't I think of that? I'll use it later but for now, I'm talking about this 'operation dazzlehead'-

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Operation PuckleBerry-

None

Did anyone fail to tell you that sounds like a piece of exotic fruit? Hmm, makes me want to have some now
None

Now that I think about it, it makes me sound like a cannibal and Sue Sylvester does not feast on humans..
None

well, except if they are puny and weak because it seems fun to pick on the sad ones.

None

A very awkward silence is present between the two rivals.

None

Uh..
None

okay
None

What do you want to know about the plan?

None

How it's all going.

None

Mr
None

Schue would never believe Sue Sylvester's words on anything in general, but for this he actually believed her
None

He probably was going insane for even trusting Sue on this, but she had the same ambition as he did, so he needed an extra ally to support and back him up if this plan was going to succeed.

None

Well, it's going surprisingly great.

None

And the footage?

None

Surprisingly, hilarious
None

Watched a bit of it myself, in fact more than fifteen times.

None

Will my dear, you really need to get a hobby, and no, Glee isn't one of them
None

Now I came to give this to you because I'm not cruel hearted, unlike you.

None

Okay, now was the time to not believe Sue's words.

None

So that was where he left the key, with Sue Sylvester? How? That was when it hit him
sylvester has no Synonyms in the API
None

It wasn't any of the Glee kids' idea for Puck and Rachel to be together, it was actually his and Sue's idea, as unusual as that sounded
None

He remembered discussing the whole banter between the two with fellow co-worker and friend Emma Pillsbury yesterday morning when Sue barged into the convo, telling the two of them that the footballer and the Gleek freak should just get together already
None

He had two copies of the closet's key, but the Glee footballers already had one, leaving a spare
None

Sue agreed to helping with his plan on three conditions â€“ one) she had the other spare, two) they would use her ideas, and three) he had to call her, You're sexiness everyday
plan has no Synonyms in the API

Mr
None

Schue reluctantly accepted â€“ unhappy about reason #three - but glad that another person was sick of Puck and Rachel yelling retorts at each other but yet, secretly wanting the other.

None

They both ambled rapidly from his office towards the janitor's closet, hearing banging from the dreaded room
None

Mr
None

Schue fumbled with the key a bit, sweat dropping down his forehead
key has no Synonyms in the API
['fumble', 'with', 'key']

To him, it felt like he was controlling life and death in the palm of his hands, and it started to piss Sue off
None

Stop flaunting your blown-up balloons and open the door already!

None

Once the key clicked through the lock, Mr
None

Schue turned the knob, opening the door and swiftly moving out of the way
None

Good thing too, since Puck and Rachel were banging on the door when it automatically opened
None

As if in slow motion, they both fell forward, toppling in the direction of the ground.

None

Puck noticed that Rachel was going to fall first then him and something inside him told him that he didn't want that to happen to her
None

Like a part of him was somehow controlling him, he gripped his hands on her shoulders, and quickly pushed her back, so now he was going to crash on the ground first
None

Unfortunately for him, his back hit the ground instead of his face
None

He was grateful that his gorgeous face, his hot bod and his manhood was still intact.

None

Until something else fell on top of him
None

Hearing a high pitched squeal made him realise that Rachel must had lost her footing before when he pushed her away from the ground, resulting to her being on top of him
None

That was when Puck realised something else â€“ 

None

 was 

None

 of 

None

!

None

And what was worse? The position they were in on the floor was very suggestive
None

How could he not pass an opportunity like this? If you wanted to be on top, you should've just asked.

None

This definitely annoyed Rachel
None

What did I just say about the pick-up lines? she shouted, scrunching her nose up with disgust, hidden freckles flaunting her structured phizog.

disgust has no Synonyms in the API
None

Puck had a sappy expression on, couldn't think how adorable she looked like that
None

He shook off his thoughts when she glanced up
None

He did too, only to realise that students were walking by, watching them in a humorous way, and that Mr
None

Schue and the Cheerios coach were gazing at them with bewilderment.

bewilderment has no Synonyms in the API
None

They were locked up in that room and yet they didn't do this in there? Sue questioned to Will, referring to the suggestive position the two teenagers were in.

None

Instantaneously, Rachel got off of Puck, straightening her outfit, and running a hand through her mocha hair repeatedly
None

Puck just whined, his happy moment ruined
None

He made a mental note to egg Sue's car after today was over.

None

What time is it? Rachel questioned, noting that many students were now leaving the cafeteria which was down the hall.

None

Puck stepped in and whispered seductively in her ear
None

It's time for us to get back into the closet and do something else in there
None

She turned to face him, seeing him wiggling his eyebrows mischieviously.

None

Like what, kicking you where the sun doesn't shine? Rachel exclaimed, smirking at her remark.

None

Puck continued to smirk even more, crossing his arms across his muscular chest
None

Ooh feisty, I dig that in a chick.

None

Before the two quarrelling duo could retort back a retort, Sue beat them to it
None

This is school

It's lunchtime on a Tuesday, ten more minutes until the final periods commence
None

And if you really want to be the stereotypical high school student, get some buck teeth and steal those glasses from that wheelies kid, it will go well with your hideous knee high socks.

Sue then turned to Puck, smirking a little
None

And 

None

, diva here is right, your pick-up lines really do suck, and I'm curious to know; do you want to be bold or not? You can't be both
None

It's like if I want to be a man, but I want to be a woman, you can't be both
None

Now I'm just contradicting myself, I'm gonna go shut up and walk away right about now.

None

And with that, she left.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

What a psychopath lady, Puck uttered, watching Sue's retreating form
None

He felt a hand placed on his shoulder, perceiving Mr
None

Schue giving him a small smile
None

I think of the same thing everyday.

None

I can't believe I missed out on a whole day's rehearsal of Glee
None

I never miss a lesson ever
None

Puck yes, but not me
None

I don't want people to pull out a file of me saying that I was tardy in my high school life when I'm number one in the charts! Rachel exclaimed, throwing a tiny fit in front of her teacher and the boy she despised so much.

None

Babe, chill
None

You've got your whole life ahead of you, so chillax, he explained, motioning his hands as if there was a rainbow in the sky.

None

I am the most easygoing person I know thankyou very much! And with that, Rachel pushed Puck down on the ground again, stomping off away from the bad boy

Unfortunately for her, Puck got back to her feet, chasing after her, leaving Mr

Schue to stare at their retreating forms bewildered.

Schue mumbled to himself, following the direction where the teenagers headed
None

It wasn't that hard, their voices were echoing through the hallway.

None

Where do you think you're going 'Miss
None

Prissy Pants', the closet is that-a-way.

None

I'm not going anywhere with you.

None

But I'm going to be your dark knight!

None

Puck, do me a favour and leave me alone!

None

Psshh, and yet my mum says you're a sweet, innocent angel
None

You're better off as the devil, wearing a red corset and devil horns, and-

AGHHH!

None

Mr
None

Schue sighed, grabbing the hidden camera from behind some cardboard boxes in the janitor's closet, closed said room's door and made his way to where he believed the two were heading; towards the Glee room
None

He just hoped that the other Glee kids were having more fun that he was right now.

None

Little did he know...

None

Roars of laughter were present in the Glee room
None

The room was a big mess, lots of popcorn thrown all over the place, as well as nachos, lollies, chips, even a half-eaten piece of hotdog, and spilt soft drinks everywhere
None

But the people in the Glee room didn't even care, or notice for that matter
None

They were just focused on one thing at that moment â€“ what â€“ or importantly 

None

 â€“ was on the television screen.

None

We need to do more than just lock them up in a closet, Quinn affirmed, grabbing a fistful of popcorn and shoving it in her mouth.

None

Finn wrapped an arm around his girlfriend's shoulder, while she happily munched her delight
None

Quinn's right, it needs to be something extreme and unexpected.

None

What about hand-cuffing them to each other? Artie suggested
None

They all laughed, imagining what it would be like if they actually did that.

None

Or kidnapping Rachel somewhere, to see if Puck really cares about her, Matt proposed
None

It would show what a 'knight in shining armour' he really is.

None

Please, Puck wouldn't even manage to fit in armour anyway, he would destroy a goodwill polished suit that would dazzle if I showed my teeth at it, Kurt piped out, filing his manicured nails.

None

Chortles came out of a few peoples' mouth as they focused back on the television.

None

They all laughed at Puck and Rachel's constant retorts when they noticed Rachel and Puck flee from the screen, Mr
None

Schue giving the camera a grim look and turning off the camera
None

Eyes widened, realising that the entertainment just ended, not because Mr
None

Schue turned off the video connection, it was because they could hear the voices of the bad boy and wannabe diva echoing through the hallway, which happened to be where they were.

None

Was not expecting that, Mercedes mumbled.

None

The world is over! Kurt screamed, clutching Katy to his chest, and hiding underneath the piano, rubbing the velvet article of clothing back and forth.

None

Kurt's right
None

Not about the world being over, but..
None

okay, just hide everything! Finn ordered.

None

Everyone scurried, grabbing cleaning equipment from one of the cabinets in the room and using mops and brooms to get rid of the evidence of food and spilt drink on the ground, while Mercedes and Tina pushed the television all the way to the back closet.

Meanwhile under the piano, Kurt held Katy in his hands, faking a sob
None

I can't cry unless I've seen West Side Story at least one and a half times, so me faking will have to do
None

Katy, I just want to let you know that I have been thinking, and we should take it to the next level.

None

Mercedes bent down and dragged Kurt from under the piano
None

Kurt, stop watching 2012, you will live past then, and enough with you and your flirts with your stupid hat
None

She along with everyone else, was getting peeved about Kurt and his new lady love.

None

Kurt glanced at his sassy friend, annoyed
None

What did I tell you before, Katy has sensitive hearing!

None

Before anyone could speak, everyone was interrupted with Puck and Rachel's bickering voices echoing closer and closer.

None

Puck, do me a favour and leave me alone!

None

Psshh, and yet my mum says you're a sweet, innocent angel

You're better off as the devil, wearing a red corset and devil horns, and-

None

Puck and Rachel had just entered the room, with Rachel making her way to Mercedes and Kurt while Puck was checking her ass out, smirking
None

Everyone glanced at each other, sneering a little, knowing what the plan was going to be next
None

Mercedes placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, acting all sympathetic to her friend
None

Girl, 

None

? We've

None

Matt, Mike and Finn coughed back laughter, with Puck giving them a stoned face look that shut them up.

None

I was locked up with that buffoon in the janitor's closet for the whole night, Rachel bellowed, pointing an accusing finger at Puck.

buffoon has no Synonyms in the API
['lock', 'with', 'buffoon']

So I guess you can say we had a 'sleepover', Puck explained to everyone, smirking and giving a flirtatious wink at Rachel.

None

Rachel scoffed and rolled her eyes at his antics, completely ignoring him, and turned her attention to Mercedes and Kurt
None

Hey Mercedes, Kurt, everyone, as well as Katy, she added, noticing the stink-eye look Kurt gave her before was now a giddy smile.

None

He poked Mercedes hard on the shoulder, seemingly annoyed
None

At least she had the courtesy and decency to acknowledge Katy's presence.

None

Mercedes sighed a long sigh, frustrated with Kurt

For the last time Kurt, it's just a stupid hat!

And for the last time, sensitive hearing! he expressed, covering Katy's sides.

Anyways, moving on
None

I need a new outfit, Rachel announced to everyone, particularly to the girls and Kurt, rather than the boys.

None

I can help you with that, Puck remarked, raising an arm and wiggling his eyebrows.

that has no Synonyms in the API

Did I ask you? No, so shut up!

My idea of an outfit would've been way better than what they would suggest.

None

I don't care; it would be more elegant and sophisticated than what you would conjure up.

None

Are you saying my outfit selections are something you don't care about? What is this? Now Kurt was in the conversation, offended with Rachel's statement.

Mercedes pulled Kurt from the collar, whispering to him, Let them talk
None

More entertainment to see before the end of the day.

None

But she just insulted my honour, my pride, my dignity, my life! Kurt exclaimed, making it a big deal.

None

Well, get over it, she whispered, clearly pissed off at her fashionista friend.

None

At least you share my pain Katy
None

Oh I love you so much, Kurt said quietly to the raven bowler hat in his hands.

None

Mercedes rolled her eyes and focused her attention at yet another bickering argument from the polar opposites
None

Unfortunate for her, the bell had rang, signalling students to commence the final periods for Tuesday.

None

Why must you drive me crazy?

None

Crazy in a sexy way right?

None

I'm too pissed off to even make a remark about that crude statement.

None

Rachel stormed off, waving her goodbyes to the Glee club and giving Puck an evil glare, and left the room, collecting her books and making her way to class
None

Pity, Puck followed after her, doing everything in his will to get her all angered up
None

And it worked.

None

So you admit that I drive you crazy in a sexy way? Now the guys owe me twenty bucks!

None

I don't really care what deals you make with Matt, Finn, Mike, Kurt and Artie, I just want you to get to class to avoid you Noah Puckerman for good.

You can't get rid of me anyway; you will miss this hunkalicious if I evaporate from thin air.

Just as Rachel and Puck's voices drifted away, Mr
None

Schue entered the Glee room, noticing every member â€“ minus them â€“ inside, who had resumed picking up their mess since they all had free periods
None

He began to chuckle, already figuring out what the New Directions clan were doing or watching in the Glee room
None

Clasped firmly in his hand was none other than the tape containing Puck and Rachel's madness from last night.

None

I'm guessing you saw everything? Mr
None

Schue asked, smiling a little, already knowing the answer.

None

He got his answer right away â€“ beaming smiles and chuckles.

None

I feel sorry for them right now, Kurt announced, plucking some fluffy cotton off of Katy.

None

Why do you say that, you constantly tell us that they should be together, Quinn affirmed, rubbing her vast stomach soothingly.

None

Because they have a lot of chemistry together, and the fact that they have 

None

 classes right now as we speak, Kurt explained, an evil grin forming on his visage.

None

Everyone burst out laughing, understanding Kurt's deciphering code
None

Even Brittany understood what he meant, well hopefully she did

Finn wiped an imaginary tear off his face, smirking his butt off

Rachel rolled her eyes with disgust, running away from him

When he was out of sight, she headed to her locker to grab her needed stationary and equipment, with a small but mysterious smile plastered on her face
smile has no Synonyms in the API

After collecting her necessities, she made her way to her first and only class that was on Tuesdays â€“ chemistry
None

She enjoyed chemistry a lot, especially since her class was learning about subatomic particles, alkanes and alkenes, but nothing could beat her love for performing in the Glee club
None

She brought her labcoat with her, incase they were going to have a practical lesson instead.

Since no one was in the room, she began to hum out the song the boys did a mash-up on a few weeks ago
None

Why she was humming to the song, she had no reason to defend herself on.

None

 She mused to herself
None

And that was when Rachel realised one downfall of chemistry â€“ 

None

 was in her class
None

Unfortunate for her, but lucky for him.

None

In fact it is thanks to him that she was sitting at the back
None

It all started at the beginning of the semester, when new classes began
None

Although she was peeved that Puck was in her class, she knew he wouldn't sit at the front, even if his life depended on it, hence him sitting at the back of the class
None

However, Rachel wasn't aware that Puck would annoy and torture her even if he was sitting at the back
None

Since their chemistry teacher was a grouchy person, she demanded that Rachel and Puck swap seats, with Rachel taking Puck's spot and vice versa..
None

unfortunate for him, meaning he had to sit at the front.

None

Rachel continued to muse about the fact that ever since that day, Puck never attended chemistry classes
None

Well, at times he did, but he never stayed for the whole lesson
None

Rachel knew for sure that today would be like any other chemistry day.

None

Boy was she wrong with that statement she told herself because someone she didn't expect to see just happened to walk through the door.

None

I must say Will; I really do feel sorry for them.

the attraction is soo obvious!

Are you sure they will be fine with..
None

you know...

They should be, I mean from what I've heard, this would be the first time in months that they would be in the same class together for the whole lessonâ€¦ apart from Glee that is.

None

That isn't what's concerning me; my only problem is that they can deal with...

None

Ohhh, well they should be, I mean did you see what happened today with them?

I'm even more impressed that they managed not to kill each other during the night!

None

They are just perfect for each other.

If only they could believe it themselves

Popcorn?

Certainly.

After hearing some yelling, they both returned to the television screen where they laughed at the hilarious misfortunes that Puck and Rachel had to endure while being locked overnight in the janitor's closet.

Ms

Sylvester? was all Rachel could muster out as she saw the Cheerios coach enter the chemistry classroom, smiling with pride while taking a seat on the teacher's chair

After five seconds, her smile turned upside down and got up, leaving the room

Sylvester viciously dragged by the ear

At that exact moment, she felt karma was biting much deeper into her ass, and she didn't like it one bit at all.

Ow, ow, ow! The person's voice whined out, getting obviously annoyed that a teacher nonetheless was pulling him against his will.

Oh stop your crying

This wouldn't have happened if you didn't wag class

I'm not gonna punish you, get showbiz girl to do that for you

And since I'm a good teacher, I'll slip you off with a warning and you can go sit at the back with wannabe Mariah, Sue ordered, messing with the boy's Mohawk and poking on his shirt collar

Sylvester was referring to
None

He glanced up to the heavens, thanking them for making this truly one of the best days of his life.

None

Meanwhile, Rachel had declared that this day was the worst day of her life
None

First, getting locked in the janitor's closet with him, and now this encounter
None

Hearing the vacant seat next to her being pulled out; she prayed that he wouldn't piss her off as he had done every single day
None

But knowing him, her wish would never be granted.

None

Like now for instance.

None

Seeing you yet again Berry? Today must be my lucky day, Puck said nonchalantly, smirking.

None

Rachel had the nerve to smack off that smirk of his; it was beginning to irritate her
None

She peeked upwards towards the heavens, a mourning look expressed on her face
None

Oh Lord, why did you do this to me? I haven't done anything bad, she pleaded, banging her head lightly on the table.

None

Oh come on, you say it like it's a bad thing, Puck stated.

None

Rachel glanced at the boy next to her, giving him an annoyed look
None

That's because 

None

! she huffed.

None

All Puck did was cross his arms across his shirt, where you can visibly see his structured hot bod
None

Rachel couldn't stop staring at his pecs, noticing how firm it would feel if she touched it or even squeezed it
None

She wouldn't admit this to anyone, not even to herself but she actually wanted to run her hands along the rugged structure
None

She realised that she kept staring at his chest for too long as Puck had also noticed this too; whose smirk just widened more.

None

Like what you see babe? he asked, perceiving what her reaction would be.

None

I do, I like the fact that your face is all rearranged, Rachel sneered, focusing her full attention on Ms
None

Sylvester, who happened to be darting her eyes back and forth at Puck and Rachel intently.

None

When Sue knew for sure that the bickering couple had finished their banters, she stood up, brushing her black jumpsuit
None

Since your normal teacher had some 'business' to take care of, I have been asked to substitute you two for detention.

None

Wait, what! Rachel roared, taken aback at her teacher's words
None

This is not a detention class; this is a chemistry classroom that I am taking right now, hence the workbenches and science equipment in the room.

None

Sue gave Rachel an evil glare
None

I have been informed that you two are meant to have chemistry classes now, and I can already see the chemistry unfolding before me.

None

After hearing Ms
None

Sylvester's words, Rachel felt her cheeks begin to fluster, and shifted in her seat uncomfortably, trying her best to avoid eye contact with the person sitting next to her
None

Puck seemed to notice this and smirked like a mad man, although finding a bit adorable that she felt insecure about the topic.

None

That was when he remembered the topic was on detention.

None

Shit! Oh man, if I get detention one more time, the coach is gonna kick me off the team for good.

None

You know swearing doesn't really solve your problem.

None

Oh really? Then please enlighten me, what is my biggest problem?

None

Your biggest problem is that you are the most competent fool jackass in this whole entire planet!

None

Sorry to break your heart sweetheart, but that is just a fact, not a problem.

None

Well you know what, I-

None

I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE, I AM PREGNANT AND WILLIAM IS THE GODDAMN FATHER!

Both teenagers turned to face the cheerleader coach, mouths agape from what they just heard come out of her mouth.

None

Are you serious? Rachel enquired, completely shocked.

None

Nahhh, just wanted to say something completely random to shut you two up, Sue confirmed, heading back to the teacher's desk in the front of the room.

None

I thought she had man parts, Puck mumbled to the diva, resulting to him on the floor
None

Good talk, he assured, thumbs up.

None

You must be wondering why no one else from your Chemistry class is here now? Well there was an announcement before lunch that mentioned anyone who is meant to have it now will have free periods instead, Sue announced.

None

Then what are we doing here then? Let's bounce, Puck sneered, heading towards the exit, glad to be rid of Sue and Chem class, but was a littleâ€¦ sad from departing from Rachel.

None

Hold it, Muck-

None

It's Puck-

None

Meh, they are all the same to me
None

Anyways, it should also be noted that you two weren't present in any of your classes today, not even in Glee club, and why is that?

None

Because this barnacle idiot and I were sadly locked up in the janitor's closet all night
None

I am saying sadly on my behalf, that meathead deserves to be locked up in there, waitâ€¦ you were present Ms
None

Sylvester, with Mr

Schue unlocking the door, Rachel affirmed to her.

None

Yes I was, but I wasn't there when you were both canoodling in there
None

Thank God for that, I would have never been able to see again, Sue stated.

None

Are you smirking Noah Puckerman? Rachel shouted at his direction, knowing intently he was.

None

It would be a lie if I said no Berry, Puck assured her while heading to her where she was sitting, giving her a smirk.

None

So anyways, since you two failed to show up to your classes while both being at school, it is my sad duty to say that I will be taking detention class with you two, Sue said, giving them both the stink-eye

This resulted to Puck being face first on the floor yet again.

So to make up for the loss of Carrie and her sexcapades, you shall both be doing this instead.

None

Before either Rachel or Puck could say anything about it, Sue beat them to it
None

You wanna know the best part? You will be assessing the person sitting next to you.

None

Sue definitely got the reaction she wanted
None

Rachel wanted to scream, and Puck wanted to burst out laughing
None

Actually, they both did that
None

Rachel raised her hand up in the air, furious
None

Ms
None

Sylvester, I have an objection to this
None

I am pretty sure you aren't qualified to give out something like this, especially if this is all information needed for a dating website!

None

Puck rolled his eyes at her response; it had to be soo knowledgeable.

None

Are you questioning my authority or are you just annoyed that you have to make an assessment about the boy next to you? I see no problem with this, Duck-

None

It's Puck...

None

My bad
None



None

 is just a normal, innocent, hormone-crazed teenaged boy, who probably just wants to get into your pants, unless he has strong feelings of love for you, but nonetheless he is innocent enough so give him a chance.

None

Puck stared at the blonde haired teacher in front of him, flabbergasted
None

One, she mispronounced his name 

None


None

Two, he definitely was a hormone-crazed teenager
None

Three, he did want to get into Rachel's pants â€“ or in her case, her short shorts under her skirts, but same thing â€“ but a part of him didn't want to do that
None

Who would've thought Sue Sylvester knew how he felt? That was definitely un-Puck like.

None

Wait a minute; did she just say something about strong feelings of love? Whoa, whoa, whoa
None

Stop right there lady
None

The only thing I 

None

 about her is-

None

Yeah, yeah, save it for filling out these sheets of paper
None

Just pretend that you two are dating and you are writing about what you love about each other, Sue proclaimed, giving both her infamous Sue Sylvester smile and headed to the front desk, pulling out a Who Weekly magazine.

None

What kind of punishment is this? Rachel questioned softly when she knew Sue was out of ear shot.

None

Who cares, I'm glad 

None

 is our punishment instead
None

So tell me darling, rank your top five favourite sex moves we perform together? Puck enquired, raising his eyebrows up and down.

None

Although Puck once again found himself on the floor a moment later, he made a mental note that since she loved to be in charge, her favourite sex move must be the missionary position.

None

While the two of them were silently writing what they defiantly 

None

 about each other, someone else was on a mission of their own, using a gossip magazine to shield what she was really doing on her mobile phone
None

Heading towards creating a new text message, only one sentence seemed to make everything go all planned.

None

, sending it to a number she would surely plan to destroy after getting this collaborated plan of theirs to work.

None

After her phone flashed a brief pop up notice that informed her that the message was sent, Sue began to laugh inwardly to herself, reading in the magazine about how the woman that won the Emmy for Outstanding Role of a Supporting Actress of that television show she forgot the name of looked incredibly exactly like her.

None

Dammit, now I have an anchoring for fruit salads, Sue mumbled, as she carefully slipped her phone back into her trackies to spy on what the bad boy and perfectionist were doing.

None

Two minutes after they were given the dating form, both the mohawked boy and the singing lover exclaimed at the same time, Finished!

None

Surprised, Sue got off her seat with the magazine in hand, and marched her way towards them
None

Picking up their sheets of paper, her plan to immediately burst out laughing came to a halt by reading only one word on each sheet.

None

When asked overall what they loved about their 'partner,' Rachel answered, NOTHING! while Puck answered, EVERYTHING!

None

You two both know that apart from the last question, you left every other question unanswered? Sue enquired, obviously pissed that the plan is now failing.

None

Fine, can you pass my sheet back, please? Rachel perked up, a devious smile playing on her features.

None

Knew you wanted to commit to this, Puck whispered in her ear, making her arms get goosebumps.

None

Please shut up before I will make you never create life again, she hissed, her pure venom tone intent.

None

While Puck chuckled at her response, Rachel was quick to jot down an answer for every other question written on the sheet
None

Looking satisfied, she handed it back to Sue, her chocolate-coloured eyes now showing a mysterious glint.

None

She got the reaction she wanted, with Sue booming at her, You can't write no comment for every other question! What is wrong with you today, I see locking you up with landing strip boy over here seemed to put your mind into a non-confessing mode.

boy has no Synonyms in the API
['lock', '-PRON-', 'with', 'boy']

Her devious smile turned upside down, mumbling a few profanities about the mohawked idiot next to her, not paying attention to what he was babbling about now.

None

I am right here, and I have a name too! And where the hell did you get 'landing strip boy' from, one of those milk cartons? Puck interjected, still annoyed that the Cheerios coach was still forgetting his name.

None

Well since you two don't wanna co-operate, would you like to stay another night at school just to finish this? Sue questioned
None

I know that The Good Wife is on, but I get to see the world premiere of how you two deal with each other by yourselves.

other has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel's orbs of vision widened at the mention of staying another night at school withâ€¦ 

None

 Ms
None

Sylvester, I beg of you
None

I will do practically almost anything to not wanting that to happen
None

I already suffered with that predicament last night; do you really want me to go through it again?

predicament has no Synonyms in the API
None

Uh, yes!

None

Did I ask you ogre? No, so zip it!

None

Honey, it's a free country so I have the freedom to say whatever I want, and my answer is, uh yes!

None

And you wonder why you are a competent fool jackass?

None

I just know that I am one whenever I am around you.

None

Hey mum and dadâ€¦ Sue interrupted the bickering couple
None

Do me a favour, and shut up
None

Since this will probably go all night, I'm going to go fetch me some popcorn
None

Don't try to maul each other when I come back, because that is Sue Sylvester's job
None

She headed back to the desk placing the magazine on it, and headed in the direction towards the door, ignoring Rachel's pleas and Puck's many thanks.

None

And to make things more interesting, Sue locked the door, so more interesting things would evolve between the two adolescents
None

Sue Sylvester, you are a son of a gun, she piped up, heading towards any place where she could find food.

None

Now that we are finally alone, let's get back to what we were doing back in the janitor's closet, eh Sunshine? Puck stated in a flirtatious manner, wrapping his arm around Rachel's shoulder once the Cheerios coach left the room.

None

She removed his arm off him, getting off her chair just to pace around and go over what her brain was registering to her at the moment
None

Deep down her mind, she pleaded that somehow Sue would come busting in and tell him off for using foul language and saying inappropriate words in a derogatory way, and give him a gruelling punishment, like wearing a Cheerios uniform all day, or even better, make him listen to love songs! Oh how she would pay 

None

 of money just to see that.

None

However, something else in her mind was yelling out loud that she liked these one-on-one encounters with the brawny simpleton
simpleton has no Synonyms in the API
['like', 'encounter', 'with', 'simpleton']

From the way he constantly ticked her off, calling her endearments that she had to admit she found some of them quite flattering and others insulting, and the need of always getting her attention
None

She wouldn't tell anyone this, but Puck was like a puppy â€“ cute and playful at the start, but downright annoying later on.

None

Wait, did she just think that?

None

Did I just think that? she asked herself out loud, her question getting the attention of said 

None

I'm guessing your mind is telling you how much you like me, no? Puck articulated, crossing his muscly arms across his chest.

None

Rachel groaned
None

I will never ever like you, not even if you were the last boy on Earth, as clichÃ© as that sounds
None

Even if you were the only guy in the world to produce future generations, I still would never like you
None

In fact, it is quite the opposite of that.

None

Yeah, I figured you didn't like me, he responded with quietly, but loud enough for Rachel to hear.

None

Immediately, she began to regret her words
None

She knew that he was a buffoon who would never leave her alone, but he was also someone with feelings
None

However, he was right; she didn't like him that way
None

So was her mind shouting out the complete opposite?

None

She faced the hazel-eyed boy from where she stood near the exit, giving a sad, sympathetic glance to him
None

I'm glad you understand.

None

You don't have to comfort me because I know you don't like me like thatâ€¦

None

I don't like you, but I don't hate you, because I-

None

Rachel never got the chance to say what she wanted to say, because she instantly saw that infamous smirk ride up on his visage, saying three important and dominant words that chilled her when he mentioned it
None

â€¦because you love me.

None

Annoyed, Rachel screeched and turned back towards the door, mumbling some swear words about the nincompoop figure in the same room as her while rattling with the knob, realisation dawning on her that she was locked in 

knob has no Synonyms in the API
['rattle', 'with', 'knob']

 room with 

None

.

None

Yep, karma was now sinking its teeth in her ass right about now.

None

Frustrated about the whole situation she was in yet again, she banged on the door, shouting and hoping anyone would save her
None

Why was it that she was getting locked up in rooms with out of everyone, the badboy Noah Puckerman? Hadn't she suffered enough with their retorts?

retort has no Synonyms in the API
['suffer', 'with', 'retort']

Apparently, fate thought it wasn't enough
None

Especially for what said badboy responded with.

None

Well since we are yet again trapped with each other, let me be the first to ask you this question: according to this sheet of paper, where is your preferred erogenous zone?

other has no Synonyms in the API
None

 Rachel thought to herself, her face scrunching up to go yell at his disgusting question.

None

Pity they didn't know that when Sue left the room, she placed a hidden voice recorder that began to play on the teacher's desk, which was covered by the gossip magazineâ€¦ and which was recording at that instant.

None

Meanwhile with Sueâ€¦

None

She searched everywhere for food, and there was none! There was, but there was no way in hell she was going to eat canned liver when the staffroom did not even have a stove
None

How McKinley High was although prestigious, was also cheap.

None

, Sue's mind ranted.

None

So for the past fifteen minutes, she scavenged the place just to find food
None

Even bursting into an art class didn't help
None

Sue learnt that although they were painting fruit, it didn't mean they were painting 

None

 fruit
None

Tasting it didn't even help the matter either.

None

She turned the corner when she heard roars of laughter coming out from the Glee room
None

Precariously, she tiptoed her way towards the room, sneaking up on the occupants of the room, eyes widened with delight with vast amounts of popcorn clutched in their hands
delight has no Synonyms in the API
amount has no Synonyms in the API
None

Now was the chance to surprise them the same way she surprised the rebel and the goodie goody.

None

I AM PREGNANT AND WILL IS THE FATHER! she boomed, startling Mr
None

Schue, Emma, and the rest of the New Directions clan, mouths agape.

None

After an awkward amount of silence, several voices spoke up all at once.

None

Dude, I thought she had man parts.

None

Will, tell me you did notâ€¦

None

What the? What the hell are you on about Sue?

None

Greattt, just what we need, another Quinn Fabray.

None

I'm right here in this room, you know that.

None

OMG Ms
None

Sylvester, congratulations, who is the father?

None

If that is true Ms
None

Sylvester, allow me to be the first to say trackies aren't a good look for you for pregnancy, and if you don't believe me, Katy can vouch for me.

None

SHUT UP!

None

After another round of awkward silences, another voice spoke up
None

Katy, I know exactly what you mean
None

I guess trackies make a woman go all psychotic during pregnancy.

None

I'm not pregnant, I just wanted to get your attention, Sue beamed; proud of what she had managed to accomplish
None

However, she was clued out as to why the rest of the Glee members were in the Glee rehearsals room when class was meant to be on
None

Nonetheless, Sue didn't care about them, screw them
None

She had her own problems to deal with, like the hormonal duo back in the Chemistry classroom, and her urge for foodâ€¦

None

We cut class just to see what went on between them again before we have after-school rehearsals, Kurt answered on behalf of the Glee clan, twirling Katy on his finger
None

So why are you here?

None

If you must know gay-shionista, I came because I am hungry, Sue announced, pushing Kurt off his seat and taking his food, munching on some popcorn
None

And because all they are doing in that room is non-stop arguing in that godforsaken room
None

I'm pretty sure I contracted other diseases apart from Hepatitis just for being in the same room with them.

None

That was when she realised something
None

Oh crap, I left them locked in the room and I bet they aren't even filling out that dating form
None

Well, gotta go, Sue exclaimed, taking Kurt's drink before she left the room
None

Toodle-a-loo.

None

Cue yet anotherâ€¦ another round of an awkward silence whenâ€¦ Did she just-

None

Duh, she took my food and drink!

None

Not that Kurt, did she say that they agreed to fill out the dating forms?

None

Five seconds later, the whole room was empty, fleeing off to where Sue went off to.

None

I still don't know why I am doing this right now, Rachel wondered out loud, referring to her now filling out the dating form
None

After banging on the door for the majority of the time since Sue left, her once energetic energy was completely drained not only from that but from the previous night
None

And for some reason, Puck out of all people managed to get her to sit downâ€¦ even if it was just to fill out the stupid dating form.

None

Come on babe, just fill it out and she will let us go, Puck urged, skimming each question on the sheet and answering it.

None

Rachel observed his actions very carefully
None

From the way his hazel eyes were skimming each word, a smirk - and at times a smile â€“ would be plastered on his lips, and his hand moving the pen he has grasping firmly to write who knows what, made her wonder as to what he had answered
None

Sure, for all she knew he could've wrote some stuff that were dirty related and knowing him, he probably did, but he must have also written some honest stuff about her as a 'girlfriend.'

None

For some reason, an unknown yet tiny small smile was placed on her features, returning to the sheet in her hands
None

If this was her way out of another night with the left tackle, then bring it on.

tackle has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'tackle']

The first question: 

None

 Rachel wandered to herself, bewildered
None

She took a rapid glance at the boy sitting next to her, pondering, 

None

Rachel Berry, one of the main vocals of New Directions would never ever, even if it was a life or death question, tell anyone this, but she actually liked his name
None

Yep, you heard right, likes the name
None

It seemed to suit his personality, character, appearance and everything about him.

None

She hastily wrote down her answer, with the boy next to her noticing she was actually answering a question, leaned over to see her response
None

Aww, I'm glad you 

None

 my name honey.

None

Don't read my answers, it is confidentialâ€¦ I think, Rachel shouted at him, whispering the last part
None

And I never said love, I said- She peeked down at her sheet to have perceived that she didn't write 'like,' she indeed wrote that she 

None

 the name.

None

Shit! Rachel cursed aloud, scribbling the answer out repeatedly.

None

Puck smiled that the girl had now contradicted her own words
None

You know, a sexy chick once told me that swearing doesn't really solve any problems.

None

Oh shi-crap! she howled, face-palming her forehead.

None

Rachel = 0, Puck = 1

None

What happened now? Did he get you pregnant? Sue asked, once coming back to the room with a food supply in her arms.

None

If we did, we would've used protection, Rachel answered, and then covered her mouth quickly from what she had just said
protection has no Synonyms in the API
None

Did she just say that?

None

Crap, did I just say that? she said out loud.

None

Although Puck didn't see the devious smirk on Sue's face, all he could think of was his mind going crazy over what the wannabe diva had just stated
None

Oh wow, he was gonna sleep well tonight for sure.

None

Rachel = 0, Puck= 69

None

Yep, he knew what he was gonna dream about.

None

Knew you wanted me, Puck beamed with a goofy smirk on his face.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

I do not want you, and what I said was mis-said, she retorted back, still recovering from what she had just said before.

None

Then what was it you were supposed to say? 

None

? he questioned, mimicking the way she had stated her response.

None

She punched his arm, frustrated
None

I do not sound like that! And I would never ever say anything like that.

None

Yeah you would, I mean it's one of the answers on your questionnaire sheet thingy-ma-bob, he calmly affirmed, waiting for her reaction.

None

He should've known he would end up on the floor once again, he just didn't think it was that soon.

None

Sue pissed herself laughing sitting in the teacher's chair, the sight in front of her amazing to watch and observe
None

She was very grateful to even be present to see this take fold
None

She was even more grateful that her voice recorder was recording all of this, and overall glad she was a part of the plan that would hopefully work
None

From what was unfolding before her, it seemed that it was.

None

I can't believe you said my best asset was none other than my ass.

None

You know you are reading confidential information right?

None

Screw the confidentiality, that is just perverted.

None

So if that is perverted, then why is your response to, 

None

 none other than, 

None

That is not a perverted comment, and it is true.

None

Ah, so her highness of hotness admits that I, the Puckmeister has a toned muscly bod?

None

I swear to God, when we get out of this room, you better run fast, because I will literally castrate you to death.

None

Well you better catch me fast, because other ladies wanna get a piece of this badboyâ€¦ unless you are jealous, is that why you want me to run from you, so you could have me to yourself? You should've just asked, I would have agreed to it.

None

They can have you for all I care, you simpleton, idiot, jackass, nitwit, dumbass, motherfucking oaf, jerk, punce-

None

Don't hide your true emotions for me babe, you are either blushing, or are green with envy.

None

Sue took a handful of popcorn and shoved it in her mouth, quickly glancing at the recording device flashing record from under the magazine, before going back to watching another round of Rachel and Puck's banters
None

She slurped the drink she stole from Kurt, staring at the two oblivious lovebirds
None

Sigh, young hidden love
None

No matter how many times they say it, denial is not just a river in Egypt.

None

Ah, so her highness of hotness admits that I, the Puckmeister has a toned muscly bod?

None

I swear to God, when we get out of this room, you better run fast, because I will literally castrate you to death.

None

Don't hide your true emotions for me babe, you are either blushing, or are green with envy.

None

Rachel groaned and began slamming her forehead on the table
None

She would rather do this for the rest of her life then endure everything that was going on around her
None

She hated Noah Puckerman, she hated not getting her way, she hated Noah Puckerman, she hated any other slushie flavour that wasn't grape, she extremely hated Noah Puckerman to the brinkâ€¦ did she mention how much she hated the boy with the mowed-lawn mohawk?

Puck, however, had a completely different view on the matter
None

He liked his encounters with the diva
diva has no Synonyms in the API
['like', 'encounter', 'with', 'diva']

Well obviously, he was pretty much the one who would always get her riled up and an argument between them would occur
None

He liked to torture her through their bickers, it was pretty much the only thing they had in common, the only way that he could get close to her, to talk to her
None

The more vocab she used towards him that he didn't understand made him want to argue with her more, mainly as she was one of the few girls to have a decent conversation with.

Nawww sweetheart, don't you worry your pretty little head
None

Just keep thinking about the hot answers you fill out on the sheet, Puck stated, smirk present
None

Oh how Rachel wanted to shoot a missile on his face if it was the only way to get that damn smirk to be gone for one second.

None

Please, please, please jump off a cliff and die, she mumbled.

None

Can't do that babe, you would miss me, Puck retorted, eyeing the petite brunette for her comeback.

None

She stopped banging her head on the table to glare at him with her doe-eyed orbs of vision

The only thing I would miss if you did jump is nothing.

You mean Jacob Black? I'll admit he has a very fit physique, and is quite charming in a mysterious way.

None

Excuse me? My real, pure guns can beat his blown-up bags any day
None

And I have some quality badass shit that can take down hisâ€¦ whatever it is he has.

None

Do you care about anything that doesn't revolve around you?

None

Of course I do! I care about peopleâ€¦ that will get smashed if they don't get out of my way.

While the duo shouted retorts at the other for the umpteenth time, at the teacher's desk Sue was at her wits trying to solve a crossword puzzle in her magazine
None

How the hell was she supposed to know the answer to this? What was she, a teacher?

None

Clearly she was, butâ€¦ shut up
None

Moving on.

None

What's a twelve-lettered word for 'a hideous and atrocious attraction'? She thought about this for a while, processing words that could fit the phrase's description

William's hair.

Oh my holy water.

She already has a hobbyâ€¦ destroying the Glee club.

â€¦Good point.

Sorry to interrupt your love-fest, but I'm sort of interested in watching a different kind of love-fest that is taking place in the room next door.

Will and Emma turned their heads to the Latina cheerleader, oblivious to their stares while filing her nails
None

After getting a feeling that someone was staring at her, she glanced up and saw their expressions
None

No offence, she blandly added.

None

Before the duo could speak, they got interrupted once again
None

None taken, Kurt spoke for the both of them
None

Now please shove loves, we're missing the show.

None

Hold on guys, Will began to say, blocking their view on purpose

Pillsbury have some sort of a romantic relationship?

Schue, if I may to cut this short, Quinn piped out next to Finn
None

The whole school gave you two a name â€“ Wemma
None

And just like Puck and Man-hands inside, it's not that hard to see something going on between the two of you.

None

Great speech from preggers, now lets get on with the show, Santana quickly applauded, before making her way to the window at the door to watch their desired audience.

Wait, Emma stepped next to Will, blocking the rest of the Glee club's view once again
None

How long has this been going on for?

None

Groan.

None

Santana was annoyed with her teacher's questions up to the point where she mentally declared that the first thing she saw she would throw â€“ which happened to be Kurt's beloved hat
question has no Synonyms in the API
None

She rolled her eyes at his antics as he tried to fix the bowler into place, glaring at her in the process
None

Did you drink testosterone by accident Santana? Katy could've got injured from your throw.

None

For the last time Kurt, it's just a damn hat, Mercedes bellowed at her friend.

None

Kurt shook his head; Mercedes clearly had no idea what kind of crap she had just said
None

It's not just a hat 'Cedes
None

You don't understand the kind of emotional connection I have with her.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Speaking of emotional connection, can we please get back to Puck and Rachel? Artie questioned, sitting patiently in his wheelchair although his expression in his faced showed how frustrated he was with the change of focus.

A-a-ar-tie's rig-ght, Tina stuttered from behind
None

We ca-ame out o-o-of class j-ju-ust f-fo-or thi-is, so le-let's ju-ju-jus-ust shu-shu-ut up!

None

Mike eyed Tina confused
None

I thought you only stuttered in publicâ€¦ you know, when you're not with the Glee club.

Tina's orbs widened
None

Whoops, you're right
None

I'm used to stuttering in front of everyone.

None

Mike smiled at Tina, who in turn blushed, which everyone had noted.

None

However, the moment had to be ruined.

None

Santana began clapping, very pissed off
None

Okay congrats female Asian, you've stopped stuttering
None

It's a miracle, hip hip hurray
None

She turned to Kurt, who was still shooting daggers at her for tossing his precious Katy
None

Fashionista, I could give you a million and five reason why you shouldn't wear that hat, but I have a serious case of CBF so I won't even bother, and Wemma, she directed her attention towards the two adults
None

I don't want to show my inner bitchy Latina side but please shove your butts out of my goddamn way!

None

Normally, Will would've told her off for cursing, but he got used to the Latina's fiery side
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was just like Puck, except female, which frightened him in a way
None

One Puck was enough as it was but twoâ€¦ and a girl that acted like him no less, was just horrible to thinkâ€¦ and it might just work
None

Fine, Will proclaimed, motioning for his students to see the door
None

With smiles on their faces, they all rushed to get first dibs to observe the action they came to see to begin with until they were interrupted by their teacher and the student councilor.

None

Again.

None

Until you tell Miss
None

Pillsbury and myself when this Wemma phenomenon began.

None

Cue another groan.

None

How are my 

None

 my best assets?

None

Hey! No peeking!

None

Just answer my question!

None

First I wrote 

None

 which you got pissed at, then I changed it to 

None

 which you got pissed at, and then I change it again to 

None

 which you got pissed at again, and before it was changed to 

None

 and now you are pissed at my answer for this? There is just no way of pleasing your tight ass.

None

Are you trying to imply that I have a pole up my bottom?

None

Well, since you're the one who said it in the first placeâ€¦

None

Troglodyte.

None

Speaka da English!

None

That was in English!

None

And so is 

None



None

Rachel felt her skull was close to breaking for her to grab her brain and destroy that to pieces, which was how much Puck affected her
None

A major part of her believed he had an impact on her in a negative way, but a teensy weensy piccoleeny part considered his impact on her was a good thing
None

But there was no way in the name of Barbra Streisand's name would she admit that out loud, more or less to the said twat next to her
None

You do know that highly inappropriate phrase translated is do you want to sleep with me tonight?

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

After seeing a cheeky grin growing on his face, she knew she couldn't take back her words
None

I didn't know you thought that way you cheeky minx, but since you asked meâ€¦ I'm all game.

None

 she mused a frustrated thought
None

Will you just shut your trap for one minute?

None

Only if your luscious plump lips are pressed to mine babe, he replied back, his hazel eyes somehow focused on her lips
None

This didn't go unnoticed by Rachel, who felt her cheeks begin to redden.

None

To avoid showing him he was succeeding in this battle, she turned away from him, trying to focus her attention on the dating questionnaire sheet, but failing miserably
None

You never give up with your conquests do you?

conquest has no Synonyms in the API
None

You say it like I'm something you want but cannot have, she heard him mumble.

None

She turned around, surprised at his words
None

I thought that was why you kept on pursuing me.

None

Your one hot, sexy chick
None

Who wouldn't want to do you five times over on top of a piano?

None

Everything goes downhill once his ego 

None

 takes over
None

You perverted pig
None

Now shut the hell up and don't talk to me.

None

But-

None

No.

None

Surprisingly, Puck obliged to Miss
None

Berry's orders
None

Say that she got him whipped to his face, find a mirror quickly while running for your life because that would be the last time you would ever see your face structured that way.

None

Despite the fact she was the one that wanted silence to begin with, she had to open her mouth
None

Rachel Berry does not do silence, even if her only companion â€“apart from the cheerleading coach at the teacher's deskâ€“ was an idiot with a hideous haircut
None

You never answered my question, she whispered
None

It made her wonder if he even heard that.

None

The one about you being uptight for having a pole wedged between your ass? Puck asked innocently, although Rachel knew that he knew which question she was referring to.

None

Not that question, but I would like to say I am not uptight.

None

Whatever floats your boat.

None

As I was saying, Rachel raised her voice slightly, just for him to shut up, and for the attention to be on her this time
None

You never answered my question.

None

I don't want to answer it, she heard him murmur, noting how his perception was at anything but her
None

Well this was bloody amazing newsâ€¦ was he blushing?

None

A smirk began to grace her features
None

Is Noah Puckerman nervous?

None

A scoff escaped his mouth
None

Puckermans don't do nervous babe, he assured her while facing her again, crossing his arms across his chest to prove his point by showing his bulky arms and giving out a scowl.

None

Then why won't you answer my question?

None

Why do you ask so many questions?

None

Puckâ€¦

None

No way would the way you said my name like that would convince me to tell you why, although you should say my name like that everytime I-

None

Puck, please don't ruin a good moment
None

Please tell me why.

None

Rachel heard him sigh, thinking he was stubborn like her and not give a response, until she heard him utter, Soft hands.

None

I'm sorry? She heard him crystal clear, but needed more clarification.

None

Soft hands, you have soft hands, he repeated
None

Seeing her chocolate eyes twinkle, he continued
None

From what I've heard from Finnessa, he kept on saying something about how soft your hands were, even when they are cold
None

But for all I know he could have been bullshitting with me, or making some lameass shit up
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

You know how dumbo he is.

None

Although the ending was ruined especially with Puck's cussing, Rachel was touched
cussing has no Synonyms in the API
None

Finn said that about her? Not that she cared, she was annoyed
None

She had this uber massive crush on him probably ever since Desperate Housewives had first started airing, and that was the only thing he would talk about in reference to her? She was very glad that she realized she had been chasing after the wrong guy when her perfect guy was next to her.

None

Wait, what?

None

Wait, what? she repeated, not believing what her inner monologue was trying to convince to her.

None

I know you're still hung up on Finn and all, but how can you not see what a dumbass he is! Just last week he texted me if I knew what my number wasâ€¦ my number! He texted me for my number! Sometimes I just want to kill him; I'm doing everyone a favour by destroying his existence! By now, Puck was drawing a stick figure of Finn on his questionnaire sheet and stabbing his pen all over the drawing
None

Poor drawing.

None

Stop hurting the illustration, Rachel said, rolling her eyes at his behaviour as he stabbed the pen multiple times through stick figure Finn's chest and the pen went through the paper.

None

Never! I'm making it feel my pain, my pain! Puck was now full of rage, pretty much decided to rip the whole questionnaire sheet altogether.

None

Rachel had seen Puck go apeshit crazy one too many times
None

She felt bad about the time when she saw Puck throw his lunchbox at Mike because he wouldn't trade lunches with him and didn't intervene
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

But yet again, they were freaking eight years old, so that didn't count.

None

Puck stop! Rachel roared, throwing the pen grasped firmly in his hand and placing her hands on top of his in an attempt to calm him down
None

Just calm down
None

Breathe in, breathe out; breathe in, breathe out.

None

I'm not gonna do that therapy shit-

None

Just do it!

None

One again, Puck followed her orders, inhaling and exhaling while waiting for her to continue speaking
None

I don't like Finn anymore
None

Well I like him as a friend, but not in the same way as I used to
None

You should learn to control your anger problems; you have hurt many people both physically and emotionally as a result of your actions.

None

Like who? he smirked, waiting for a list to come out of her skirt pocket with everyone's name written down.

name has no Synonyms in the API
['come', 'with', 'name']

Me, she mouthed, glancing down at her lap, but Puck saw her lips move.

None

His smirk died down to a grim line
None

It pained him to know he did all those terrible things to her, and yet he was making her life even more of a living hell by flirting with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

If he could change back time and undo all those times he threw slushies at her, and hit the old him in the ball sack, he would
None

He took his hands out of her grasp and took hers in his instead
None

I really am sorry for that
None

I'm not sorry for slushing those other losers, but I'm sorry I did that to you
None

I don't know why I did it, but I really am sorry
None

I don't think I can ever express how sorry I am.

None

You know that I can forgive but I will never forget, Rachel stated sadly.

None

I know I know I know, but, Puck's orbs gazed into her mocha eyes, boring his apologies through his eyes
None

If he couldn't say it in words, maybe he could express it through his orbs of vision
None

He never considered it, but Rachel's eyes were a lovely shade of brown
None

Always full of life, admiration, twinkling, and looking into them made you feel the happiest you had ever been, like now for him.

None

For Rachel, she felt something just by looking into his eyes
None

She assumed it was lust, but closer inspection made her realize there was no trace of that evident in those hazel eyes
None

It wasn't love, as harsh as it might be to say out loud, she believed that term wasn't featured in Puck's dictionary
None

But there was something there, a mixture of other emotions she had never seen present on the young man in front of her, and she wanted to break down the walls he had built to hide from, just to find them and release them
None

Rachel already knew she was losing her mind, but she could've sworn she heard someone shout, Just fuck each other already!

None

Having the decency to actually find out who cursed those horrible words, she tried to move out of her seat, only to find out she was tugged forward by Puck still holding her small hands in his large ones
None

When she twirled around in her seat, she was closer to him than before, and she wanted to move more closely towards him
None

But at the same time, she didn't want to break eye contact with the mohawked teen; his eyes were just intoxicating and hypnotizing to not turn away from.

None

As usual, those rare moments never last long.

None

Yo, Joey and Pacey, they heard Sue shout in their direction.

None

Puck banged his fist on the table, breaking eye contact with Rachel to shoot daggers at the cheerleading coach
None

If looks could kill, he would've blown Sue up seventeen and a half times already
None

Rachel had to grab his hand again to calm him down, and so he wouldn't get up and strange Sue.

None

What? Puck groaned, not wanting to hear from Sue how he should get a room with the wannabe diva
None

He would love to; heck they were in a room right now if only the damn teacher would leave and not lock the door this time.

None

What's that film called with Alicia Silverstone where she plays some rich kid help this loser chick be popular and try to hook her up with some guy, who is oblivious to her so-called 'step brother' having a thing for her? Sue enquired, ignoring the tone of his voice and watching both of the teens intently, hoping they weren't dumb but at the same time not figure out her true intentions.

['hook', '-PRON-', 'with', 'guy']

Clueless, they both responded at the same time, coincidentally gazing â€“according to Sueâ€“ into the other's eyes as they gave their answer, unknown to the fact that they were still holding hands.

None

Sue smirked at the two, going back to her magazine as a cover up to hide the fact she was taking a picture on her phone
None

And that's what the two of you are, you crazy Jews.

None

Just fuck each other already!

None

Seven seconds and a wrestle in the mud laterâ€¦ Ewww! I cannot believe you sucked my finger Santana!

None

Oh please Matt, get over it
None

Why are you whining, it's not the first time I've sucked something from your body.

None

Nine pairs of eyes stared at the Latina, seven of them disgusted, one of them embarrassed, and the other smiling like a goof ball
None

Did she suck cream from your boobies as well? Brittany asked Matt.

None

Not wanting to answer that ridiculous question, Matt distanced himself from the blonde.

None

Did you have to shout that out loud? Tina questioned
None

Mr
None

Schue and Miss
None

Pillsbury are still looking for us, and they could've heard that and found us easily.

None

Long story short, when Mr
None

Schue had asked his students when the relationship of Wemma had began, they did the one thing that has proven effective in many situations â€“ they ran
None

Except for Artie and Tina, who waited for the two adults to chase the rest of the clan before scooting off themselves
None

Eventually the students all found each other, and were now watching Puck and Rachel outside the science labâ€¦ that was until Santana was frustrated that PuckleBerry had sexual chemistry and weren't taking any action whatsoever and began to cuss.

None

In my defence, they are two horny teens that know they want each other but are not doing anything about it
None

I'm merely giving them the push they need to pounce, Santana clarified, satisfied with her answer.

None

Guys shush, Ms
None

Sylvester just asked them something, Mercedes hissed, using her hands as binoculars to hopely get a better view.

None

Everyone else â€“except Artie and Kurt, Artie was wheelchaired, and Kurt was sitting on Artie's lap to not step on the mud and ruin his new Alexander McQueen bootsâ€“ scooted towards the window, either watching or listening to the scene unfolding before them.

None

Seriously Ms
None

Sylvester? Even I knew the answer to that, and it's not because I'm Asian.

None

Nine pairs of eyes stare back at Mike, not even bothering to comment.

None

You've watched Clueless? Quinn asked, trying to hide a laugh.

None

Mike was struggling for a reason why
None

Uhâ€¦umâ€¦ wellâ€¦ I bet he has! he bellowed, pointing an accusing finger at Kurt, still sitting on Artie's lap.

None

Duh, I'm gay, Kurt responded simply, twirling Katy around his finger.

None

BURN! Santana howled, slapping Mike's arm.

None

Next thing to happen, Mike was dripping wet from head to toe
None

He turned to Brittany, annoyed and confused
None

Why did you just pour water all over me?

None

Brittany still smiled her goofy smile
None

Santana said burn, and I don't want you to be on fire so I poured water from my bottle on you to kill the fire, and it worked.

None

Just like Matt did moments before, Mike also distanced himself from the blonde.

None

Everyone returned their gaze to the window and it was a comfortable silence for a while, until Tina commented, If Puck was Asian, he would look like Taeyang, and he is pretty good looking
None

Except I prefer Onew, I love fried chicken.

None

Nine pairs of eyes glanced in Tina's direction, one filled with joy and delight while the other eight gave her the same blank expression with a clear message â€“ what the fuck are you on about?

joy has no Synonyms in the API
None

Seeing the eight faces of blankness, she rolled her eyes
None

It's an Asian thing, she articulated, dismissing the matter.

None

Always running to a different subject, aren't you Lucy Liu? Santana huffed.

None

Speaking of running, Finn piped out, pointing to something in the distance
None

The members of New Directions â€“except the two insideâ€“ all gasped when they saw the figures of Will and Emma running after them.

None

RUN! they all shouted, except for Artie and Kurt, who shouted to Tina, PUSH!

None

To the ham and cheese of my ham and cheese sandwich, Sue declared, rising from her chair, obviously referring to the two â€“she assumed horny though she knew the boy was moreâ€“ teens fighting over the dating sheet
None

Since Puck ripped his to shreds, he decided to read Rachel's answers since he believed it was fair he read out one of his answers
None

Rachel, clearly, didn't think that was the case, so now they were both fighting over possession of the questionnaire sheet
None

To think they wanted nothing to do with it a moment ago, and to think they were holding hands like long lost lovers reunited just before
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

But as the saying goes â€“ all good things must come to an end.

None

I'm gonna go get me some refills because my awesome body is craving some fruit salad, and I blame the two of you
None

Damn you and your names
None

DAMN YOU! Sue howled, heading towards the entrance and opening the door
None

I better not expect this door to be opened when I come back, I know where you two people go to school, and with that, she left, locking the door behind her.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Four and three quarters of a second laterâ€¦ She's gone, Puck cheerfully sang, turning his full attention to the brunette.

None

No Puck, we are not going to make out, Rachel assured him, pulling for her questionnaire sheet from his grasp.

None

As much as I know you don't mean that and I wouldn't mind some of that right now, I was actually referring to something else, he pointed out, getting up of his seat and heading towards the window.

None

Curiosity got the better of Rachel to enquire, What are you doing?

None

It wasn't until she saw him pick up two Bunsen Burners that she realized what he was doing
None

Puck, I will not have you blow up the Science laboratory!

None

Relax Princess; I'm not trying to do that
None

Although that is a sweet idea, I shall use that another time, so thanks babe, he thanked her, winking in the process.

None

Then what are you trying to do, get yourself killed?

None

You would cry for me if that was the case, but I'm doing this instead
None

And with that, he threw the two Bunsen burners at the window, hoping the impact would break the glass
that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Instead, they bounced off the window, only leaving a few marks.

None

Fuckity fuck fuck, Puck cursed, kicking one of the Bunsen burners and breaking off the metal piece that changed the colour of the flame.

None

This got Rachel irritated
None

She stalked towards him, tapping her foot impatiently
None

You neanderthal! Don't break school property!

None

Honey, school is a prison and we are the prisoners
None

Think of it as us trying to escape to reach freedom.

None

So in other words, the prisoners are breaking out of prison.

None

Yeah, that too.

None

Like Bunsen burners would actually help?

None

I had to try something
None

You heard her lock the door, I'd break the door but I've broken so many doors
None

Windows however, that I've never done
None

And besides, you only live once
None

Live life to the fullest, because the next minute, you could be wounded by a mortar shell while eating some cheese and drinking wine.

None

Rachel smiled at his last comment
None

For some odd reason, Puck had for once completed his English homework, and was now reciting how the war was random in 

None


None

Just because he actually finished homework for once did not mean he could sweet talk her into joining him in escaping the laboratory, even if she didn't want to stay here any longer
None

I'm still not joining you.

None

Puck glanced at her with a glint in his orbs
glint has no Synonyms in the API
None

I never said you had to, but I would appreciate the company, and we could get back to you wanting to make out with me, he smirked.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Which is a reason to stay here, Rachel affirmed, pulling a seat at one of the tables at the front of the class.

None

Your loss babe, he assured her, resuming to find anything to throw at the window.

None

Rachel eyed the chemistry laboratory closely
None

It was a long time since she sat at the front of this class, ever since the punce in front of her kept distracting her from her learning
None

She cocked her head to the side and when she noticed fire extinguishers lined up next to each other near the entrance
None

So the school cannot afford to send twelve students to a singing competition, but they can afford 

None

 fire extinguishers for a classroom alone? I'm going to tell my daddy to file a lawsuit about this.

None

What are you on about? Puck questioned, looking at what the diva was referring to
None

After seeing what she was blabbering about, a grin that would rival the Cheshire cat's smile was plastered on his visage
None

You are a genius Berry.

None

What are you on ab- Next thing she knew, she was shouting profanities at the badboy for using one of the extinguishers to break the window.

None

Are you done with your yapping? Puck wondered, peeking at an imaginary watch on his arm.

yapping has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm not yapping, and no I'm not finished

I'm still not going with you, she huffed.

Actually, I think you should come with me, he informed her.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She eyed him warily
None

And why is that?

None

Because when that crazy ass teacher comes back and sees the window broken, my sexy form gone and you here, she'll blame you for the window.

None

She would not! I think out of the two of us, she would defiantly know it was you who broke the window.

None

It could've been you trying to frame an innocent handsome man, and then what's your alibi?

None

Damn, he had her there
None

But she was sick of his presence
None

Going with him would mean she would break some rules, be a rebel herself
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

But she did not want to be blamed for something she did not commit
None

Why was he so damn hot?

None

Fine, I'll join you
None

But on one condition.

None

And what's that honeybunch?

None

Make that two conditions â€“ one, no funny business, and two, stop calling me those words you believe are endearments.

None

Can't promise baby.

None

What had she gotten herself into?

None

Ladies first.

None

Oh no
None

You're just either going to cope a feel like last time or try to peek up my skirt like last time
None

No, you go first.

None

You worry too much, but fine I'll go first.

None

She was not worried for him when he decided to jump out the window as if he was swimming the freestroke
None

She heard some sort of splash, and a part of her was thrilled she did not volunteer to go first
None

But now she had second thoughts if this was the best way to leave the classroom.

None

Hurry up damsel in distress, your Prince Charming has to take a piss.

None

That didn't help her decision making.

None

Shush you criminal
None

Are you sure this is safe?

None

She saw him roll his eyes
None

Babe, my arms are open for you so I can catch you when you fall
None

And this is probably the most action I'll have with a girl in a month.

girl has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'with', 'girl']

Too much information to know
None

Wait, a month? Was he becoming celibate?

None

If you drop me or I become injured because you fail at catching, expect a lawsuit in your direction, she threatened, bracing herself for her doom.

None

Just jump you baby!

None

So jump she did
None

Except when Puck caught her, he thought it would be funny the moment she was in his arms, he would drop her
None

Fine, he did it to piss her off and get her all riled up and also to get her dirty
None

If his phone hadn't died the previous night, he would have taken a pic of her right then and set it as his wallpaper
None

But witnessing her like this was a start.

None

Even though it was mud all over her, she was still damn sexy
None

Especially when she was angry
None

At him
None

You jerkface idiot!

None

What did I do? he asked innocently.

None

You know what you did; you dropped me on purpose for your own amusement
None

You're going to pay for this you troll!

None

Does payment involve making out?

None

Expect to die Noah Puckerman, expect your fucking ass to die!

None

And the chase between Rachel Berry and Noah Puckerman began across the football field.

None

Come back here Puckerman!

None

I'd like to survive before my kid is born thank you very much.

None

I'll tell the child you conceived with Quinn and everyone else the story about how you were killed, and it will go along the lines of me murdering your sorry ass!

quinn has no Synonyms in the API
None

Instead why don't you tell everyone else the story about how you murdered my cock repeatedly that one time when it was a hot summer night, and you used your amazing tongue to-

everyone has no Synonyms in the API
None

That will never ever happen you disgusting pervert!

None

And the two began to wrestle in the mud.

None

If you wanted to be on top, you should've just asked babe.

None

How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me those names?

None

Well you're making it hard for me to not say how hot and sexy you are, even when you're covered in mud.

None

And since you're covered in mud, eat mud pig!

None

â€¦Did you just throw mud at my face? You're going down baby!

None

Catch me if you can!

None

I plan to do more than that after when I do!

None

Have we gotten away from them? Mercedes glanced around, hoping to not see a tuft of curly hair or ginger hair in her peripheral vision.

None

Yep
None

Thank the fucking lord, Santana muttered, filing her nails.

None

Although I have to wonder why the hell we are hiding under the bleachers, the other diva of the club wondered out loud.

None

Trust me, we're safe
None

Once, Brittany and I couldn't be bothered going to cheer practice so we hid under here when Sylvester was hunting us down
None

And since we had nothing else to do, we made out under the bleachers.

None

Mercedes wanted to vomit
None

Too much information.

None

Before Santana could respond, the two heard some loud bickering from the football field and both peered from where they were under the bleachers to see who they were
None

When the girls heard shouting from a girl and taunting from a guy, they both had their suspicions to which those two could be
None

And their suspicions were both confirmed when they saw a girl with a short skirt with mud all over herself and a guy with a mohawk being wrestled in the mud by said girl.

None

Santana chuckled, very happy
None

Hah
None

So that extra push worked after all.

None

Mercedes glanced to the Latina, confused
None

What are you on about Santana?

None

Santana rolled her eyes, but gave her companion next to her a response
None

What I mean BeyoncÃ© is that I'd like to think today is the day they both got their jiggy on.

None

If you wanted to be on top, you should've just asked babe.

None

How many times do I have to tell you to stop calling me those names?

None

Well you're making it hard for me to not say how hot and sexy you are, even when you're covered in mud.

None

And since you're covered in mud, eat mud pig!

None

â€¦Did you just throw mud at my face? You're going down baby!

None

Catch me if you can!

None

I plan to do more than that after when I do!

None

Rachel knew it was immature of her to do so, but she just couldn't let the opportunity slide
None

Whipping her head back to face the boy chasing her, she stuck her tongue out in a childish manner; somewhat hoping her simple action would get him more annoyed.

None

It worked
None

Puck was very annoyed
None

When he said he planned to do more after he caught her, he wasn't joking
None

He was serious
None

Exactly what it was he had planned if he had managed to catch up to her he did not actually know, but felt that the idea would come to him eventually
None

Despite long grueling hours of football training and considering Rachel's size, she still managed to slightly outrun him
None



None

 But to be honest, he had never seen this side of her before
None

Heck, it made her seemâ€¦ cute
None

Cute in a deer way with her doe-like irises teasing him
None

He really should stop watching Disney films with his sister, especially Bambi.

sister has no Synonyms in the API
['watch', 'film', 'with', 'sister']

He needed to get these sappy thoughts out of his head, and he was glad that Rachel stumbled up ahead of him that he used as an advantage to edge closer to her
None

Sadly his thoughts returned to him and were now registering how carefree she looked with her mocha hair blowing everywhere
carefree has no Synonyms in the API
None

When she was in Glee club â€“or anywhere for that matterâ€“ she was always her prissy self, but observing her now revealed a side he had never seen before
None

And Puck quite liked itâ€¦ probably without the mud clinging to her clothes and the rest of her body.

None

But even with the sludge on her petite form, it made her more beautiful than before.

sludge has no Synonyms in the API
['make', 'with', 'sludge']

Whoa, where the heck did that musing come from?

None

After hearing the hurrying steps of mud behind her had died down, Rachel turned to observe a dumbstruck Puck just staring
None

After whipping her head around to see if there was anyone behind her, she came to the conclusion that he was probably just staring into space or wherever the hell teenaged boys like Puck were thinking of when their expressions were like that
None

Not rushing back to him if he was bluffing, she took leisurely steps towards the badboy, keeping a fair distance incase it turned out to be a deception.

None

Puck? Rachel hesitantly questioned, waving a hand in the direction he was staring at, even though she was a few metres away from the boy
None

Observing that he was still in the same condition and position he was in moments before, she stepped closer until she was face to face with him.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

What the hell was she supposed to do now? If she tried to slap his face (while feeling his rugged cheeks at the same time), he would pounce and she would be killed
None

If she tried to reach out and grab his arms (while feeling how hard and muscular they felt), he would pounce and she would be killed
None

If she tried to place her hands on his chest (while trying to find where his nipple ring was located despite him having a shirt on), he would pounce and she would be killed
None

She didn't even want to know what would happen if she tried to kiss him
None

Not that she wanted to, it was just a measly thoughtâ€¦ so she muses.

None

So either way, no matter what the outcome was, she would be eaten by her predator.

None

So Rachel Berry did the one thing that made her actions feel neutral â€“ she did nothing but stare at him, stare at his muddy face (courtesy of her), stare into his hypnotic orbs of hazel.

None

Noticing his mohawk was in disarray due to her mud throwing, she reluctantly made her right hand move towards his lawn-mowed head
None

She could've sworn Puck's irises had flashed a different kind of emotion, one she was familiar with but never seen him express it to anyone.

None

Rejection.

None

But why would he feel, or be rejected? Puck was one of the most popular boys at McKinley High
None

Many, if not all the girls (but Rachelâ€¦ her mind for some reason thought otherwise) wants him, and all the boys wanted to be himâ€¦ heck she was sure some boys even wanted him just as much as the girls wanted him, if a confession from Kurt was anything to go by
None

He was, as eloquently dubbed by the man himself, an ambadassador, someone that everyone fears because of his tough guy exterior and his record of bad behaviour
None

He had something she didn't have â€“ people knowing your name and knowing who you are, that is not said in a negative connotation
None

He had fellow students eating out of the palm of his hands, and he was the one who would more likely reject others
None

He was everything she wasn't, so why did it seem like the tables had turned?

None

That was when she figured it out the reason behind his peculiar expression â€“ he thought she was going to slap his face
None

Well, that was Rachel's assumption anyway, since his beautiful eyes had slightly widened and he had flinched a little when her hand made contact with the mud on his head
None

She might as well set the record straight before he assumed something else with her actions.

action has no Synonyms in the API
['assume', 'something', 'with', 'action']

I'm not going to hurt you, she softly told him, showing him the mud that was attached to his unnecessary hair cut and tossing it over her shoulder; while her other hand smoothed out his mohawk as best as she could
None

She knew she should just stop whatever the hell she was doing but her body felt like it was possessed and some other form was controlling her, although her mind was telling her she just wanted an excuse to touch him.

None

Puck followed her movements with his eyes and just contemplated her
eye has no Synonyms in the API
['follow', 'movement', 'with', 'eye']

One minute she is pissing the world off, the next minute she shows a carefree side no one would believe she had
None

He always knew she was the kind of person that was hard to decipher, especially with her ever-changing ape shit split personalities, but he liked the fact that he always had the chance to see her 'evolve'â€¦ since Puck was pretty sure he was the one that made her go through several metamorphoses
personality has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'personality']

From the way she was playing with his 'hawk, he would not have mind her doing that for the rest of his lifeâ€¦ as long as he could be 

hawk has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'hawk']

 for the rest of his life
None

God, she was going to be the death of him.

None

Berry, Puck breathed out, watching her reaction
None

Her slight shiver went unnoticed by him, and he liked it
None

Time for his plan to commence
None

I wasn't kidding when I said you had soft hands.

None

Rachel did not know which was more unexpected â€“ him saying those words, or the fact that after he spoke said words, he grabbed her hands from his lawn-mowed head and held it in his
None

She knew it was a big mistake to look into his eyes, especially when he was boring everything into her
None

All the emotions she observed from staring into his irises before made their presence again, and a part of her liked how she would bring it out of him
None

She just did not understand why he would characterize himself and proclaim to everyone else how much of a badass he was when what she was seeing right now were the exact opposite
None

Why was this boy so hard to figure out?

None

Like now for instance, with his thumbs brushing itself around her knuckles and his stare much more intense than before
None

Rachel wondered if this was how he used the Puckerman charm on other females, because although she would never ever admit it out loud or even to her diary, the charm seemed to be working on her
None

His stare just made her feel important, feel appreciated, feelâ€¦ cared for
None

She always hoped that someday, someone would look at her the same way Puck was currently looking at her
None

She unconsciously licked her lips due to his orbs boring into hers, noticing how his grip on her tiny hands was slightly tighter
None

She was nervous yet curious to wonder what would occur next, and she did not have to wait anytime soon, with his chiseled face moving precariously towards hers.

None

Their staring war still going on, Rachel bit her bottom lip, resulting to a low growl from the young man in front of her that she barely heard
None

This was it, the predator was going to kill his prey, and if she was honest, she had a feeling it would happen, just not this soon
None

She could feel Puck's breath heaving closer towards where she stood frozen â€“not because he was still holding her handsâ€“, just not wanting to flee
None

Her hands felt clammy, but pulling them away made Puck grip her hands tighter again, not wanting her to slip through his fingers.

None

When she closed her orbs of vision, he knew from then it was all or nothing
None

Taking the first move, his lips were just mere centimetres away from her plump lips, more reason to smack it to his
None

He would win in five four, three, tw-

None

RING!

None

Fucking hell, he muttered under his breath before he opened his eyes and looked into her now opened chocolate eyes, all confused
None

Oh god, why was she looking at him like that? With the expression she had on her face at the moment; he wanted to smash his lips on hers and corrupt her innocence forever
None

Heck, he literally would have planned on doing that if he did not have maths class at the moment
None

Knowing him, he did not give a rat's ass about maths and what was currently being learnt on the curriculum about stupid quadratic functions but not going to this class would mean not being able to play the big game on Friday
None

He begrudgingly let go of his hold on the petite girl, taking a step back, and heading back to the school with his hands in his pockets, kicking the mud with annoyance while muttering expletives at the same time
hand has no Synonyms in the API
['head', 'with', 'hand']

He glanced over his shoulder one more time, a pang feeling emerging from the deep pits of his stomach.

None

He did not do anything to her â€“that was remotely badass in the last five minutesâ€“ but he felt he had hurt her more right at that moment than when he used to slushie her daily.

None

'

None

 was all he could think on the way to his maths class.

None

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH?! ARGH! WHYYYYYYYYYY?

None

Calm down Santana! I know you want them, crazy Jews to go hump like bunnies, but we all need to take one step at a time
None

Them included.

None

It's just thatâ€¦ *sniffle* they were so close and we were so close in seeing Jews go all the way
None

Heck, I was waiting for them to get to first base and nothing happened, because of that stupid bell! Fuck you bell!

None

Tell me the reason you are acting like this is because it is your time of the month.

None

No, my hormones act this way when I'm pregnant.

None

Mercedes halted her steps and raised an eyebrow at the cheerleader
None

There was already one pregnant cheerleader in the club; they did not need another pregnant cheerleader
None

Especially if that cheerleader was Santana Lopez
None

â€¦ You're a really strange Latina.

None

Santana twirled to face Mercedes and waved around her mobile phone in her face, a smirk starting to form
None

At least I'm a strange Latina with video footage of them running after the other and almost having a hot make out session because it's their way of foreplay!

None

'

None

 was the only thought running repeatedly through Rachel Berry's mind.

None

She could not believe what had just occurred a moment ago
None

One minute she was locked in a room overnight with an idiot, the next minute she was in detention with said idiot, the minute after that she was hunting down the same idiot across the football field, then some sort of silent tension occurred with the same idiotic person with the mohawk, and now she was just watching the very same douchebag of an idiot walking away from her until his figure was no longer in her peripheral vision
idiot has no Synonyms in the API
['lock', 'with', 'idiot']

She thought he had somewhat managed to figure him out, but after this, he just made his bricked walls become harder for her to blow down.

None

Rachel thought Puck had wanted this, since he pretty much kept pestering to her about making out with him half the damn time they ever had an encounterâ€¦ which always results to arguments â€“in her defense, he would start every single one of themâ€“ so why didn't he?

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She would never dare tell a soul, but he looked more attractive and roguish with mud and dirt all over himâ€¦ not that he was attractive or roguish at all to begin with.

mud has no Synonyms in the API
['look', 'with', 'mud']

Looking down at her now muddy attire, Rachel sighed and ran a hand through her knotty hair
None

At this time on Tuesday afternoon, she would be in Chemistry but since that class was now a detention session for some reason â€“a part of her wondered if Sue knew her and the mohawk barbarian escaped the locked classroom by nowâ€“ and she was out on the field covered in slosh, she might as well dry herself off while students were in class to avoid the harsh insults before Glee started
None

Exhaling a breath she had not realized she was holding, Rachel trudged towards McKinley High, her shoes and the muddy field emitting a squishy sound every time they made contact with each other.

None

She could not help but wonder why would someone like Noah Puckerman try to make a move on her anyway? I mean look at her â€“ she was Rachel Barbra Berry, future Broadway star in the making, not to mention she acted like a diva at times, was too controlling, considered high maintenance according to everyone in McKinley, mostly everyone cannot stand her, was one of the selected few that many people picked on, and last but not leastâ€¦ she was short, just to name a few
None

It just did not make sense
None



None

 did not make sense.

None

She made sure to wipe her dirty flats on the scratchy mats that were located in one of the entrances in the school, so she wouldn't get in trouble for leaving a massive trail of mud marking her as the perpetrator
None

Finding the girls' bathroom sign nearby, she made her way slowly whilst making sure no one was in the corridors to make more fun of her
None

Heading straight towards the sink once the door gently closed behind, she carefully peeled her shirt off, leaving her with a singlet while trying to wash off the mud from her pale shirt
singlet has no Synonyms in the API
['leave', '-PRON-', 'with', 'singlet']

Out of all the times to wear a white shirt and not bring a spare change of clothesâ€¦

None

The bathroom door suddenly opened and the Jewish girl froze, her name called out in a questioning manner, and she was anticipating for the harsh words to start commencing, starting with her muddy attire
attire has no Synonyms in the API
['start', 'with', 'attire']

To her surprise, she was not expecting Brittany to be by herself, but Rachel still had her doubts â€“ usually wherever Brittany was, Santana was somewhere nearby
None

Watch'a doin'? Oh my goofy goober, did your poop come out your mouth? That happened to me once, but it tasted like carrots
None

What does yours taste like?

None

The brunette girl blinked, very confused
None

Here she was covered in icky mud from hair to flats, an opportunity for anyone, even Mr
None

Schue to make fun of her, and despite Brittany's cluelessness, she was a cheerio nonetheless, meaning she was on top of the social hierarchy ladder, meaning she must insult others to stay coolâ€¦ so why was she not doing that now?

None

Not wanting to tell her off or be rude to Brittany, since she never even done anything bad to her ever which she found odd, considering the blonde was a cheerleader, Rachel answered her question
None

It is mud actually; it is just hard getting this stain off
None

And I am confident to say that the substance that arose from your mouth was vomit.

None

You're wrong, vomit is when it tastes like brussel sprouts, the blonde cheerily stated, her gym bag she was holding placed on top of the sink, so she could find her make-up kit.

None

Not wanting to have a quarrel with the cheerleader, Rachel decided to go along with what she was saying
None

Now that you mention it, when I threw up when I was eight years old due to having gastro from consuming some poorly made salad with feta cheese, my vomit did taste oddly like that awful tasting vegetable.

cheese has no Synonyms in the API

Brittany in return looked at her in amazement
None

I know right? And then she observed the brunette
None

Don't you have any spare clothes?

None

Sadly no
None

I thought I had packed a spare change of clothes but I remembered I never came home last night because Iâ€¦ had a sleepover and this was my spare clothes that I changed into yesterday, she explained, remembering the whole slushie ordeal at lunch yesterday
None

Just as she remembered that, she also remembered another fact â€“ she had gone to the bathroom to clean off the slushee and Puck came in to start another round of their bickers
None

She prayed he would not show this time, she could not handle it well if he did.

None

Shaking her head to get rid of the memory of him, Rachel was about to continue her conversation when something red and white was thrown in her direction
None

Startled, she was flabbergasted to observe a red and white cheerios jersey jacket in her hands, and had to look at Brittany for an explanation
None

When poop came out of my mouth at a party last week, it went all over the white top I had too
None

I had my lucky jacket with me and when I put it on to hide my poop stain; many people were fainting around me because of my jacket
None

It is very lucky and I want you to use it because you will become a king when you wear it.

None

Rachel wondered if Brittany should be notified that the people might have fainted because of the smell of vomit, not because she was a cheerleader and therefore popular, but she was desperate for a piece of clothing, and the said article had long sleeves so that was a bonus
None

There was no way she was walking and practicing in Glee with a singlet where everyone will stare at how much skin she was showing that was not her legs.

You have no idea how eternally grateful I am for this
None

Thank you so much Brittany, I will reward you with some of my cookies, Rachel exclaimed, hugging the girl, forgetting her bottom half was still muddy.

some has no Synonyms in the API
None

Brittany didn't seem to care though, returning the hug to the diva
None

Thanks, your cookies feel nice.

None

Rachel slightly pulled away but laughed
None

Brittany may be clueless, but she had perfect timing when it came to making people laugh
None

She even thought what Brittany was doing to her clothes was just a ruse to make her laugh, until she heard the sound of a zipper unzipping from under her cheerios uniform
None

No Brittany, it is fine really
None

Please do not take off your shorts, Rachel began to say, looking away from the blonde while her hand was furiously telling her to stop.

None

But you need spare clothes
None

You are like a Barbie doll, and I don't like leaving my Barbie dolls naked at the bottom, Brittany clarified, stopping her action from unzipping her shorts.

None

But I have my own pair of denim shorts underneath, the brunette explained, touching her shorts which felt more muddy and wet than her shirt and skirt combined
None

And it was all Puckerman's fault
None

Sigh
None

After Brittany's shorts came off and once again handed it to Rachel, she had no choice but to take her piece of clothing again
None

There was no way she was going to be sitting with a soaked pair of denim shorts, and there was no way she going to stand and look like an idiot
pair has no Synonyms in the API
None

You didn't have to, Rachel began to say, extremely grateful there were some kind hearted people in this godforsaken world.

None

The bell rang, startling the both of them (Rachel thinks the heavens are making time go fast so she can kill herself sooner) so Brittany grabbed her gym bag, twirled around and left the bathroom, waving a goodbye to her before saying her final words
None

It's fine; I have nothing underneath my skirt anyway.

None

Look at my pot pie, my pot pie's amazing, Sue cheerily sang down the corridor, inhaling the chicken pot pie in her hand and thanking whoever's pot pie it was that she took
None

Hey, she did not steal the food if there was no name on it
None

Fumbling for the keys in her pocket that will open the laboratory door in front of her, she wondered what the two horny Jews would be doing once she entered the classroom
None

Would they be at first base? Would they skip all and head straight for home? Would they be dead? As long as Sue had her phone to record and take pictures of the scene, all will be swell.

None

Your favourite teacher in the milky way is backâ€¦ what the fried chicken? she screeched, observing the Bunsen burners and fire extinguishers scattered on the floor and the window all smashed
None

As well as the perpetrators gone.

None

Sue should have been annoyed
None

Annoyed at Will, annoyed at Puck and Rachel, annoyed at Will's hair
None

Heck, she should have been annoyed at the fact she dropped the chicken pot pie she borrowed â€“and will never returnâ€“ was now splattered across the floor, but she was not
None

In fact, she was smirking
None

Why was she smirking?

None

Because although the Puckleberry plan was ruined due to her stomach, an alternative path took its course
None

Because on the table lay Rachel's dating questionnaire sheet.

None

I think I might have lost fifteen pounds just from running from Mr
None

Schue and Miss
None

Pillsbury.

None

You stopped to get two packets of chips at a vending machine Finn
None

I don't think you would have lost any pounds, more or less fifteen.

None

If Quinn is in bitchy alert for insulting Finn like that, it means she was pissed he didn't give her any to eat.

None

I am not going to ask why you know that Rutherford.

None

Matt knows that fact because his sister is pregnant as well, Mike.

None

Pretty much all pregnant women are like that Arthur
None

It is common sense really, like how Katy looks fabulous on my head when she is tilted.

None

Not the hat thing again Kurt! We're sick of you mentioning her every time!

None

What are you yapping about this time Asian Buffy? And where is my Britt-Britt schmoopsie poo?

None

Seriously Santana, tell me the reason you are acting like this is because it is your time of the month.

I think you should bow down to your queen Mercedes as I am finally here!

None

All nine pairs of eyes turned towards Brittany, with an uber mega watt smile plastered on her face, waving at everyone in the same action the queen would address her people
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

My jacket makes me king and since I am not wearing my jacket, I am a queen
None

I have no power until I am king again.

None

At least I know you escaped and survived the Battle of Wemma Britt, Santana said, giving a warm smile to her best friend
None

She faced the rest of the club with a smirk that would rival Puck's and Sue's combined, pulling out her phone from her jacket
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

But guess which two people were chasing each other around the football field in mud just about to reach first base?

None

Who? a voice called out, and Santana noticed that whoever asked that question was not any of the nine pairs of eyes that were crowding around her phone
None

In fact, they weren't looking at her anymore, but whatever â€“or whoeverâ€“ was behind her
None

She practically twirled in her spot, her orbs widening when she saw Puck standing there, now mud-less â€“although you could see the mud stainsâ€“ and his hands in his pockets with an are-you-going-to-fucking-tell-me-or-fucking-not expression
None

From what I heard when I came in, you said just about to reach first base, so who were about to pash the shit out of each other?

None

'You and your midget soul mate,' Santana mused in her mind while she breathed out a breath she had not realized she held, relieved Puck did not arrive five seconds before those words
None

Plastering the smirk she had on before the bad boy walked in, the words coming out of her mouth all bullshit
None

The janitor and the lunch lady
None

Him giving her a smile made me want to cough up the tacos I ate in my cousin's quinceaÃ±era three years ago
None

And those tacos turned out to be poisoned!

None

HA! Will exclaimed, bursting into the room with Emma nowhere in sight
None

You guys are all busted! I knew you would be here
None

Emma said none of you would but I said Emma, sectionals is only a few weeks away, so of course they would show up to the afterschool class, otherwise Rachel would go mad and call the FBI on them
None

By now, he was rambling on, the heat getting to him
None

So now we are here and alas we have caught you! Now you are all going to tell us about this Wemma phenomenon you were talking about when we were spying on- That was when he realized Puck was in the room, very much concerned for his teacher
None

Puck? Puck! Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wha-wha-what are you doing he-he-her-here? Shouldn't you with Racâ€¦ raccoons in the p-p-park?

None

I may have been a fake stutterer, but at least I was convincing
None

Mr
None

Schue is just embarrassing at it, Tina whispered, face-palming herself.

None

Mr
None

Schue, no offence but are you on crack? Mike enquired, concerned for his teacher and his odd behaviour.

None

Is Mr
None

Schue acting like this because he broke a bone? Brittany piped out
None

One time my uncle broke a few bones from falling off the couch and he was acting the same way as Mr
None

Schue right now
None

Except he was also moving his arms and dancing in one spot.

None

Blink went the eyes
None

Are you sure he was not having a seizure? Artie asked the blonde cheerleader.

None

Brittany shook her head with a goofy smile

None

No silly, he didn't have any scissors on him.

None

Glad the attention was off of him for now, Mr
None

Schue fanned himself to calm down, asking the students to take a seat so the lesson can begin
None

Now are there any questions before we begin today's lessons?

None

Yeah, where's Berry? Puck called out, and all eyes were on him, curious that he was interested in her whereabouts
None

Noticing this, Puck squirmed in his seat while crossing his arms to flaunt his guns, tempting anyone in the room to ask him why he was concerned about the resident diva, and explained further
None

She hasn't pissed off the world yet so it would not be that hard to find her even if she was in jail.

None

That's because you make her lose her blow, Santana mumbled whilst smirking, earning a few chuckles from her fellow teammates.

None

A voice announced in the hallway, There is no need to panic everyone; I am finally here after I had endured a bit of a rough patch in the past two days, but I have put that past behind me and I am ready to win sectionals!

None

Everyone looked up and all jaws were dropped to the floor as Rachel entered the room, all orbs staring at her attire, consisting of a cheerio jersey and a pair of ripped, pale turquoise shorts
None

Puck, of course could not help but stare at how those shorts showed off more leg than she ever had when she wore her goddamn skirts
None

He was in for the ride of his life when he hit the shower tonight.

None

How does it feel to be king? Brittany piped up in her seat at the back next to Santana.

None

I will be honest Brittany, I actually understand what you mean by being a king in this jacket, or in my case a princess, since I am female and my marital status is single, the brunette answered, twirling around in the red and white jacket.

None

Mercedes sang in a sing-a-long voice
None

Oh she won't be single for long.

None

Berry, what the fuck are you wearing? Puck asked aloud, looking over Rachel a second time and smirked his approval, ignoring the Schue's muttering of watching his language.

None

Clothes, was Rachel's response, unaffected by her choice of clothes
None

Like she had a choice to begin with.

None

Looks more like you are trying to draw some attention to yourselfâ€¦ more than you already do.

None

Every student that was not Puck or Rachel groaned as loud as they could
None

Only Puck would say something stupid 

None

 offend Rachel Berry at the same time
None

Seriously, what is the matter with that boy? Mercedes questioned out loud.

None

Rachel turning into a volcano would have been an understatement
None

Excuse me? What did you just say? Finn was pretty sure lava was going to come out of her mouth with every word she spoke
word has no Synonyms in the API
None

What are you suggesting, that I so-call 'whore' myself out like Santana? â€¦ No offence Santana.

None

Oh I am pretty sure that was meant to be a compliment, Santana commented with gritted teeth.

Seriously Berry, have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately?

None

Strike one, Matt called out in hushed tones.

None

Are you trying to insinuate that I am ugly?

None

I'm saying that with those clothes, you just want to be raped.

clothe has no Synonyms in the API
None

Strike two, Mike called out, joining in on Matt's commentary as Puck leapt out of his seat and approached Rachel, who was fuming in her spot
None

Sure, Rachel noted how he was practically towering over her, but she could always kick him in the nuts if all else failed.

None

That has to be one of the most horrendous things to have ever come out of your mouth.

None

I can show you how to make you come with my mouth helping.

None

Ooh, foul, Artie called out, also chiming in with Changerford
changerford has no Synonyms in the API
None

Can he step up to the plate?

None

You are the vilest, disgusting and neanderthalic person in this universe, and I hope you remember my words when you drop dead in your jail cell at the age of twenty-seven.

None

And I hope you babe are in rehab for your constant tics and crazy attacks.

None

Strike three! Mike, Matt and Artie shouted, as Puck and Rachel stormed out of the Glee room and went their separate ways
None

The smoke coming out of their ears could still be seen in the room And he is outâ€¦ literally out the room, Mike added.

None

Are you done with the football commentary? Quinn enquired, looking annoyed that the trio found Puckleberry argument no
commentary has no Synonyms in the API
None

784 a joke.

None

Looks like Puck is jealous that Rachel is showing more skin to everyone than to him, Tina noted, before adding, Even though it was more leg skin.

None

He is not the only one affected; Rachel is even making up words to support her arguments
None

I mean 'neanderthalic?' Come on! Kurt sighed, twirling Katy around on his finger
None

He was never letting this hat out of his sight ever.

None

If only the jacket she was wearing belonged to a footballer that is not Puckerman, remarked Quinn, a devious smile forming after saying her words
None

And that will definitely be arranged very soon.

None

While the Glee club discussed what their next approach would be in their plan to get Puckleberry together, neglecting the fact they were meant to commence a Glee lesson and they were two members short, Will just stared at the exit, expecting Rachel and/or Puck (it wasn't that he disliked Puck, it was just that knowing the boy, he would wag any class if he got the chance, Glee club included) to come back through the door
None

After a few minutes, all Will could say was, But class had not even started.

None

Mr
None

Schue, if I may, Quinn commented, walking â€“more like waddlingâ€“ past him to nab an unopened packet of Cheetos, scaring the bejesus out of him
None

She may be pregnant but she was very good at sneaking up on people
None

You may as well as join in our conversation since we are not going to pay attention to whatever you planned for today
None

Just accept the fact that Puck and Rachel are always going to want to kill each other, even if our plan succeeds
None

They are total opposites but it makes us want them to get together even more
None

She is the yin to his yang, the peanut butter to his jelly sandwich, the fruit to his loop, the pop to his tart.

None

With that, both the pregnant blonde and the teacher both chuckled at the double entendre she slipped in
None

No wonder Pluto isn't regarded as a planet, it's all due to those two
None

Because of them, there is going to be another round between Mars vs
None

Venus.

None

A/N I know I haven't updated my other Glee fic in a long 

None

 time, but I read a story in the Angle section and decided that a glee fic of a similar nature needed to be written

This will be sad, just a warning

Mr
None

Schuster walked into the practice room, expecting it to be empty
None

The door creaked open to reveal the Glee club sitting on the floor, holding hands
None

Opening the crack wider he saw the football team, the Cheerios, the play kids, the hockey kids, Emma and even Sue all sitting together, holding hands
None

They made a circle around a picture of a spunky brunette, some candles and a bouquet of lilies
None

Someone was saying a prayer in Hebrew and the kids were repeating it back as well as they could
None

Soft music played in the background, a mixed cd of the songs the Glee club had been working on and the songs she had posted on MySpace
None

The faces of the members of the circle flickered in and out of focus as the flames flickered
None

Tears ran down many of the students' faces, and Mr
None

Schue couldn't help but join them in their sorrow.

None

He said only one sentence
None

Just three words
None

The room fell silent as he cleared his throat.

None

She's gone guys.

None

No one spoke, no one moved
None

Tears just ran down everyone's face as the candles surrounding Rachel Berry's picture died out one by one.

None

Dear Berry,

None

I don't even know why I'm writing this letter to you
None

It's not like you'll ever get it or anything
None

Mr
None

Schue said it would be good for us, so we're taking this meeting of Glee to all write to you
None

You wouldn't have liked it, would you? I mean, we're wasting our rehearsal time writing these letters
None

Well, not wasting it
None

Anything we do for you can't be wasted time.

None

Did I really just write that? Oh well, it doesn't really matter, it's not like anyone will ever read these or anything, considering
None

How could you do that to us Rachel? Honestly, we need, no, we 

None

 you
None

Not that you ever noticed
None

You we're too busy with your dreams for the Oscars or the Emmy's or whatever other awards you wanted
None

You didn't travel here on Earth
None

Maybe that's why you did it
None

You came down and reality disappointed you so much that you couldn't stay any longer
None

Or maybe it was me
None

It was me, wasn't it? It's because I used you to get to Quinn, even though you used me to get to Finn
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

It was because I threw slushies in your face every day
None

It was because I couldn't stop Krownoski from leaving that damn party drunk
None

It was because my idea of an apology date was awful
None

It was because I couldn't convince you to stay at the game until the billboard said 'I'm sorry Rachel'
None

It was because I couldn't stop you from jumping in front of his car
None

It was because I'm not good enough, wasn't it.

None

And I'm rambling
None

Look at that Rach, you made Noah Puckerman ramble
None

I never thought I would do that, but you made me
None

You made me do a lot of things Rachel
None

You made me happy for once in my sorry life, that was a biggie
None

You made me realize that I had potential
None

You made me try
None

You let me be myself
None

You refused to call me by that stupid nickname and made me be me
None

You made me sing.

None

Rachel, you made me a better person
None

Not that that would have been hard (I can't give you too big an ego now can I?), but you're the only one who was willing to try
None

I was so awful before I joined Glee, before I started hanging out with you
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I threw Kurt into the dumpster every day
None

I orchestrated many of the cruel pranks pulled on you and the rest of the Gleeks
None

I knocked up Quinn Fabray
None

Yes, I know, it's insane
None

Not so much the me having sex, let's be honest, but the Quinn part
None

It feels good to get that off my chest, even in a letter no one will ever read
None

I feel really lousy about it
None

I never wanted Quinn, she was just second best
None

Unfortunately I realized that approximately 10 seconds after you dumped me
None

Therefore it was too late on the Quinn front and I was too late to save you.

None

I wonder what you would say to me right now
None

Would it be something like, Noah Puckerman, I cannot believe what you did to Quinn!! before you started to hit me? Or would you just give me advice and talk like someone way older than they really are? That's what you are, 

None

, Rachel
None

Wise beyond your years
None

I miss your advice Rachel
None

You tried your hardest not to judge people when you imparted life lessons, but you always did
None

And even though you wouldn't approve, you would never tell anyone if we didn't want you to, you would just sit there and listen
None

You let us be ourselves around you.

None

Everyone else is torn up too Rach
None

You really tore the school apart when youâ€¦ I don't want to write it
None

That will make it final
None

You know what, everyone else is writing a letter
None

You can read theirs, if you can read, where ever you are
None

I just can't write this anymore
None

It's too painful
None

Like putting salt and lemon juice in a gaping hole in my heart
None

I can't do this right now.

None

Remember, to the well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure

(Yes, I read Harry Potter

You said you wanted to talk about them, but we can't now.)

Dear Rachel,

None

I really hated you, did you know that? I despised you with every fiber of my being
fiber has no Synonyms in the API
['despise', '-PRON-', 'with', 'fiber']

You were annoying, your voice drove me up the wall, you were a know it all and you were a geek
None

I was perfectly content to hate you for the rest of my life without getting to know you.

None

But then I joined Glee
None

Sure it was to be Sue's spy and destroy your life to get Finn back, but I joined
None

And then I met you
None

You were nice to me, even though I was awful to you
None

I knew that it was because you wanted to steal Finn from me, but still
None

And when everyone found out about the pregnancy you didn't ridicule me
None

You stood by me, took abuse from me to make me feel better
None

And when Finn found out Puck was the father? Even though you told him you made sure I was ok
None

Me, not Finn, not Puck
None

That meant so much.

None

I never knew how much you meant to me until after you were dead
None

I know it sounds corny, and I so don't do corny, but it's the truth
None

I don't even know how you did it, keeping it all together when people teased you, when I teased you
None

It is absolutely awful
None

Its not just the slushies or what they do to you physically, its the mental warfare that is truely terrible
None

No one realizes how much damage a teenager can do with a snide remark, a pointed word
remark has no Synonyms in the API

Quite frankly I'm surprised you didn't commit suicide after everything that I put you through
None

And you had to worry about Jacob and the jocks and, well, just about everyone in the entire school.

None

Me? I don't know how I'm going to get through without you
None

We were on our way to becomingfriends
None

You understood, you were passionate, driven and just a little bit physotic
None

We were alike in so many ways
None

The biggest difference is that you weren't stupid enough to get knocked up by your boyfriend's best friend
None

If you had been a cheerleader, or if I had been a geek (which so would never happen
None

You had cool potential, but I don't think I could ever sink down to the level of geekdom) we would have been best friends, I'm almost certain
None

I would have had Puck and you would have had Finn and together we would have ruled the school
None

But instead I threw slushies at you and got the football team and every other person in the school to hate and tease you, just because I was threatened by you.

None

Things aren't like that now though
None

Puck and Finn don't talk anymore
None

I've only seen Finn twice since sectionals
None

Once was at the funeral
None

For being a huge guy he really knows how to make himself scarce

Puck is still trying to help, but I just want to be left alone with my baby girl

I'm naming her Rachel, if you didn't know
None

I decided the moment you asked me if I was ok, because that's when I realized that you had been the only constant through out my pregnancy
None

Finn and Puck had been hot and cold, but you were always lukewarm, there but disapproving
None

I wish that we had been better friends, because then it wouldn't have been weird if I named my kid Rachel, and you probably wouldn't be dead right now
None

But that's all water under the bridge now
None

Somethings you just can't change.

None

There's been a lot of talk about how you died
None

Some people say you jumped off a bridge, or a building, or drowned yourself or any of the other usual methods of suicide
None

Some people say some one killed you, but no one hated you enough to do that
None

Well, I don't think anyone did
None

My favorite rumor was that you hung yourself in the theater while playing the theme from The Phantom of the Opera on repeat
None

Its so insanely dramatic that you would have thought it was a ridiculous idea and considered it at the same time, mostly because its such a good show.

None

I got you tickets to go see it
None

I thought it could be a peace offering, me taking you to go see a show at the theater in Columbus
None

Mr
None

Schue was going to drive us, he thought it was a great bonding activity for the Glee club's leading females
None

I still have the tickets
None

The show was on the same day as your funeral
None

I put them on my bulletin board in Finn's basement so I would never forget how much regret can come from being cruel to someone
None

I don't think you killed yourself, you had too many dreams
None

I don't think anyone killed you, you were too out of reach
None

I think that you just died
None

It could have been from food poisoning or cancer or a million other things, but it doesn't really matter
None

All that matters is that I lost a friend the day you died, and I will never forget that.

A/N I know its been long, but please review? And tell me whose letter you want next
None

Except for Finn's, his is going last.

think I own Glee? I wish I did, but my genie seems to be broken.

A/N Hi
None

Please don't kill me
None

I understand that I suck at updating- real life is a pesky distractor :(

So I sat down to write either Kurt or Mercedes's letter, but Santana's what came out

So here it is

Dear Rachel,

None

Guess what everyone always told me- life sucks and then you die
None

Cheery, right? Well that's what I had to deal with
None

Day in and day out my mom yelled at me while my drunk dad beat on her until he got killed in a bar fight
None

Just another sob story.

None

Bet you didn't know that
None

No one did
None

Honestly, you're the first person I've told
None

Seriously
None

Britt and Quinn and the rest of the Cheerios are all just as clueless as the rest of the school
None

I don't like people thinking that I'm different from them, that instead of a rich daddy giving me money to drive around in my expensive car I'm working two jobs after school so I can help my mom pay for the house and so I can afford cheering.

None

But no on knows that
None

I guess I told you because I know you can't tell anyone and I just needed to get this off my chest
None

And yeah, it's weird that in this letter I'm spilling my heart out to a dead girl who I hated while she was alive.

None

But I never hated you
None

Not really
None

I was jealous and afraid
None

I wanted Puck for years and practically jumped him before he even gave me the time of day, but you, you just walked past him and he got all hot for you
None

And you didn't even know it
None

That's the frustrating part about you, what really gets everyone angry- you just don't know
None

You're completely clueless to the Rachel that everyone else sees and it pisses some of us off
None

The rest it terrifies
None

You aren't- weren't- afraid to show the world exactly who you are- were- in a world of fakes and pretenders hiding behind the masks life gave us.

None

I don't know if you ever saw through my mask
None

We barley talked, even in Glee, and when we did I was usually a bitch to you
None

Sorry
None

It's just, I'm so afraid
None

I want to be with Britt, to walk around and be proud of who I am, but I'm too scared
britt has no Synonyms in the API

I've spent so long cowering in the shadow of Quinn, then pushed around by Coach Sylvester, and before that my dad, that I've forgotten how to be myself.

None

You showed me that though
None

Even though we were never close I need you to know that you've helped me in so many ways
None

Who knows, maybe you'll give me the courage I need to talk to Britt, to stand up for myself, to be who I really am.

None

So thank you Rachel, thank you from the bottom of my heart (which is deeper then you will ever know, deeper than a lot of people know, actually),

None

Santana

None

Dear Rachel,

None

Do you have any idea how much easier it is to talk, well write, to you now that you're dead? I mean, I kinda (really) hated you while you were alive, which was a shame, considering we could have been friends
None

We could have bonded over shopping and gossip.

None

Speaking of shopping, you always had a crappy fashion sense, but really, a few hours in the mall with me could have easily fixed that
None

I feel like maybe if I had tried to be nicer to you maybe you would still be alive.

None

No one really knows what happened to you
None

I wonder if you have any idea what happened
None

After my mom died I realized it's a lot easier for someone to die without even knowing what happened.

None

Maybe that's why it's easier for me to move on
None

I don't want to be mean Rach, really I don't, but it's true
None

I can move on because, no offense, you aren't the first person I lost, or the closest to me.

None

But all of this is making me sad and sad SO does not go with this new Marc Jacobs sweater I'm wearing (it's green and grey and you totally could have pulled it off, not that I ever would have told you

Did I ever tell you that even though I hated your style I was always impressed with how good you looked? No? Well, there you go, a compliment for one Ms

Berry courtesy of moi), so I'm going to move onto some happier stuff.

None

Remember when I flubbed the Defying Gravity solo? I did it for you as much as I did it for my dad
None

You were so good, so strong but somehow so insecure
None

I knew that I could make it without the solo but you couldn't
None

Maybe music was making up for your missing mom like fashion was making up for my dead mom
None

See, we really aren't so different.

None

I really wish we were friends
None

We had so much in common; Finn, no mom, few friends, and no standing on the social ladder
None

We could have gotten along
None

Well, I guess that ship has sailed.

None

Stay fabulous darling,

None

Kurt

A/N Sorry my update took so long
None

I lost inspiration for a while but season 2 brought it back
None

The next letter should be up shortly.

None

Rachel,

None

Writing this seems pointless, but my boy Kurt said it helped him so I'll give it a go.

None

You're dead
None

I don't know why this bothers me, but it does
None

You were a stuck up spoiled brat who always got the solos, even when I knew I could sing them better
None

But then I started to sing more and understood your need to be in the spotlight all the time
None

It feels awesome, like nothing could ever hurt you
None

I get that now, get you now.

None

It really sucks that you're dead
None

Your funeral was yesterday and a ton of people showed up
None

Everyone who was at the party, plus the Gleeks, the football team and even the Cheerios (and Sue!) were there
None

I'm not really sure why most of them did come- probably for the free food
None

Only the Gleeks really mourned you though
None

We lost our glue when you died.

None

Rachel, you've left the club in shambles and I don't know what to do
None

No one wants to take your place, no one can take your place, but we feel like we have to have someone lead us
None

And I thought you might want to know, we're performing at Sectionals one short, despite the rules
None

No one blames us and anyone who tries to force us to perform with a fill in will get smacked down by Puck and me

We've got your back girl, even if you are six feet under.

Miss you (and I can't believe I do),

Mercedes

None

Dear Rachel,

None

Santana and Quinn and Puck and sometimes even Finn used to say that they wished you would light yourself on fire
None

I never really understood that- wouldn't that hurt you? Maybe that was their point, they wanted to hurt you
None

I never wanted to hurt you, but I think I did.

None

I'm sorry if I hurt you
None

I didn't mean to, but it can get so lonely
None

I'm not that smart, so when Santana became my friend I felt like she had been sent to me by God
None

Or maybe Santa, because I did ask for a friend for Christmas the year I met her
None

Either way, I was willing to do anything to keep her as a friend
None

She told me to be mean to you, so I was
None

Simple as that.

None

If it wasn't so simple, if I had a chance to make friends without her, I would have been nicer
None

I always liked you, you were pretty and had a nice voice, even if you talked a lot
None

And even if I didn't always understand what you said, you were never mean to me
None

I miss that
None

And I miss you
None

And Glee misses you- it's just not the same without you here.

None

Love,

Brittney

P.S
None

It's Valentine's Day, so if you're a ghost or an angel and read this letter, can you send some happy feelings Finn's way? He seems really down today.

None

Love (again),

Brittney

None

Dear Rachel,

None

It's Valentine's Day, so it seems fitting that I write a letter to the girl who opened up my heart
None

Yep, you broke through my shell and got me dancing again
None

I never thought I would because both of my parents find it strange that a grown boy wants to spend his time 

None

.

None

You showed me that I could be great
None

You opened up an opportunity for all of us to sing, to dance, to soar
None

You allowed us to become who we were meant to be, to use our talents and spread, well, glee
None

I have never been as happy as I was when you and Finn were singing and I was just dancing, losing myself in the music.

None

I haven't done that since you died
None

I still dance, don't get me wrong, but it seems forced, unnatural
None

I don't flow with the music quite like I used to, and the music seems to get stuck in everyone's throat, like their waiting for you to start the song, to finish the chord.

It's lonely without you in Glee
None

We used to be a group, united with one purpose
purpose has no Synonyms in the API
None

Now we're all islands, separated by our grief
None

As much as most of the club hates to admit you kept us together
None

Without you Glee seems pointless
None

Without you, I'm not as upset that I'm moving in three weeks
None

Yes, I'm moving
None

When I joined Glee I thought it would be hard to leave, that I wouldn't be able to tear myself away from the experience
None

Now that you're gone though, it won't be that bad
None

I'll have fond memories, but I won't have to stay and watch Glee die without you.

None

You were the star Rachel Berry, Glee's own sun
None

Without you, we're just a bunch of planets, spiraling out of orbit into nothingness.

BEYOND THESE ROADS

None

A bag of clothes, her favorite purple pillow and blanket set, a flashlight, a first aid kit, some food that will last for about 3 days, her iPod, all of her savings and a full tank
None

She may be extremely upset, she may be running away, but a portion of her is still the old, unbroken, Rachel Berry, all organized and sensible
None

She pressed on the gas pedal hard
None

Hoping to be free from it all.

None

She's sorrowful, because, for one, she's going to miss her dads
None

She really does love them tremendously
None

Really! You're asking why she didn't say goodbye personally? She didn't say goodbye to them in person because she was sure she won't be able to go through with it if she had
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She fought, and is still fighting the urge to make a U-turn because until now, she's still trying to fully convince herself that she did the right thing.

None

She, of course, would also miss her co-glee clubbers- the original ones
None

They were like her second family
None

They were really dear to her heart
None

They were there at first, at the beginning of her depression, but as it went on long enough, they all gave up on her
None

That includes Mr
None

Scheuster
None

They were part of the reason she left.

None

'

None

 These were the words she chanted in her mind over and over and over again
None



None

 She thought self-pityingly to herself, then sighed heartily.

None

He was the main reason she left
None

Finn, the boy she was and possibly still in love with
None

She just found out that his girlfriend, and not to mention, the bane of her existence, whose favorite hobby was to torture her, was pregnant, and that Finn, totally aware that she had a huge thing for him, manipulated her into going back to glee, for his selfish, but not so selfish purposes
None

It still hurt like hell though.

None

The name calling, the other hurtful comments by none other than the queen of McKinley high, Quinn Fabray, A.K.A, Finn's pregnant girlfriend, the slushies, bizarrely, not thrown by puck, but were never stopped, as that tradition was continued by the other sports jocks and the occasional cheerio
None

These experiences were just the cherries atop her misery and torture filled high school life of two years
None

She should really be used to it by now
None

But she just wasn't
None

No one can be that strong.

None

She left, mostly because, after the massive revelation, the realization finally kicked in
None

He could never be with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Or love her for that matter
None

Never

She said with such bitterness

She couldn't bear seeing him with another girl, while she's just there, being all sad and miserable.

girl has no Synonyms in the API
['see', '-PRON-', 'with', 'girl']

She was depressed and everyone noticed
None

She was distant, unfriendly, aloof all the time
None

Her dads were the most concerned ones
None

Not only because they were her dads, but also because they were utterly and completely clueless
None

They had no single clue what was happening in their precious princess' awesome (miserable) life, because Rachel refused to talk to them about anything
None

They were totally oblivious about her life in school because she makes up stories about how wonderful it is
None

That's why they were stunned at the unexpected shift in her attitude
None

She broke down without them even knowing the reason behind it
None

She just broke down.

None

This continued for a long period of time, until she couldn't take it anymore
None

She was drowning in her own misery
None

She knew if she wasn't out of that place soon, she would die
None

So that's when she got to the conclusion
None

She wanted to be free
None

She's going to runaway, maybe come back when she has recovered
None

She'd travel go back to her fathers when her depression subsided
None

She did not want them to see her like that
None

So she packed up and drove.

None

She was driving ceaselessly for what seemed like forever
None

She had no direction
None

She had no idea where she was
None

To make matters worse, she heard an explosion and saw a thick cloud of smoke coming out of the hood of the car
None

So she pulled up in the side of the road
None

She was starting to hyperventilate
None

She was in the middle of nowhere and it was getting dark
None

Then, at that exact moment, it began to rain
None

Hard
None

This is just terrific!

None

She was full on panicking like she was dying, which was a huge possibility at the moment
None

Her mind was freaking out
None

Her whole body was shaking like crazy
None

She was horrified by the situation she was in
None

she always was sheltered; everything was practically handed to her
None

Sure she was organized and extremely responsible but those things just didn't apply in that circumstance.

None

In the middle of her panicking, she thought maybe she could try to fix it
None

So she got out of the car
None

She then realized how hard it really was raining
None

It was pouring, and this only added to her fear and alarm that already was as big as the titanic at the moment.

None

She opened the hood of the tiny sedan and desperately tried to remember the things her dad and daddy taught her about cars and tires and engines and bolts
None

But her mind was buried too deep in panic to even register a thought.

None

The only thought that stuck to her brain was go find someone to help her
None

The calm Rachel would think that was absurd and illogical and unreasonable
None

But at the moment, she wasn't normal Rachel
None

She was mad, crazy, freaked Rachel
None

Freaked Rachel was pretty close to calm, normal Rachel, except normal Rachel thought straight
None

Normal Rachel thought rationally
None

Freaked Rachel on the other was completely and utterly crazy.

None

The last thing she was thinking about was calling someone for help
None

She did not notice her feet move hastily through the rain
None

She didn't notice her shoes come off a mile behind
None

She was running now
None

It was still raining cats and dogs
None

The adrenaline was flowing rapidly through her body.

None

When her mind finally came back to her, she can no longer see her car
None

The sky was dark and gloomy and When the fuck will it stop raining?!she yelled
None

Just then, the side effects of her running got to her
None

She was feeling weak and felt like fainting
None

She was shivering involuntarily.

None

Just about the time she felt her senses failing her, she felt two strong arms held and carried her bridal style
None

She was freaking out but couldn't find her voice or her strength to fight whoever this person was
None

It was a huge possibility this person was a murderer or maybe even worse
None

A rapist/murderer
None

She was screaming in the inside
None

She tried to fight him off, but the only thing that resulted to was her tightening her grip on his muscled shoulder
None

Then she passed out.

None

The last thing she remembered was that shoulder and muscled chest and abdomen pressed to her side
None

Her holding on to a faceless body.

None

Slowly, she opened her eyes and was surprised at the sight that was before her
None

A perfectly strong, and completely naked back
None

The muscles were flexing underneath some moist, tanned skin
None

She had to admit, the view in front of her was seamless
None

Until her eyes traveled upward to find a familiar haircut
None

A haircut that stood out anywhere
None

She only knew one person with that haircut, and that person despised her, and she somewhat returned the favor
None

they were not, absolutely not friends nor acquaintances
None

but there he is, Noah 'Puck' puckerman in all his glory.

None

Moments later, he shifted his body a little to look at her
None

The next thing she saw was a pair of dark, almost black with anger, hazel eyes.

None

 she asked herself
None

An even better question came to mind, when she found her voice.

None

What are you doing here? she questioned him with a raspy voice.

voice has no Synonyms in the API
['question', '-PRON-', 'with', 'voice']

What the fuck were you thinking?!? Puck yelled at her
None

It was like his voice woke her up completely and took in her surroundings and her current position.

None

She was in the backseat of his double cab pickup truck
None

A very tight space for two people to be in
None

her head was resting on a folded up blanket
None

Her legs were splayed on either side of him, which was extremely awkward, because of how small the area was.

None

Then she realized something even more awkward
None

She was dresses in nothing but her underwear; her blood seemed to concentrate on her only thing that was covering her up (barely) was his letterman jacket
None

Its smell filled her senses
None

That smell was incredibly enticing, for some odd reason
None

The scent was a mixture of cologne, deodorant and pure masculinity
None



None

she thought to herself.

None

She noticed, their clothes were hung on the back of the front seats
None

She also noticed the rain had died down into a light shower.

None

She was trying real hard not to stare at his perfectly molded abdominal region
None

Did she mention it was perfect?

None

 she thought once more.

None

She was shaken out of her thoughts when he repeated his question, this time with more rage and fury
rage has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was taken aback by that
None

Then just like that, tears came pouring down her face.

None

Noah's face softened instantly
None

Before she knew what she was doing, she was in his arms, him awkwardly sitting there, and her sobbing into his bare chest
None

Seconds later, she felt both of his arms envelop her into a soothing embrace, rubbing circles on her back, Sorryâ€¦ youâ€¦ i.
None

umm didn't meanâ€¦
None

He stuttered out.

None

She didn't answer back
None

She wasn't capable of saying or doing anything in that moment.

None

She thought all the tears were gone already
None

She remembered how she cried herself to sleep every night for a while, back in her darkened bedroom, until one day, it just stopped
None

No matter how sad she felt, no matter how hard she tried, the tears just didn't show up
None

She hasn't cried for three months straight after the tears ceased
None

She didn't know exactly what happened or how he did it- he has somehow woken up the tears and the deep emotion buried in her chest
None

There she was, a mess in his arms, her tears seemed to be endless.

None

A while later, the tears stopped
None

Noah was laying on his back, still shirtless, with her on top of him, now only in her underwear, his letterman jacket serving as a blanket for both of them
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

His hands were wrapped around her small frame
None

Her face was snuggled up against his neck
None

Their legs a tangled mess
None

That sleeping arrangement seemed natural and comfortable for the unconscious pair.

None

The morning will sure be awkward as hell.

None

PEACE OUT!

None

and

None

GOD BLESS YOU ALL!

None

:D

None

She moved in next door to his house when he was twelve
None

The first time they met was her first night being his neighbor
None

His mom invited her and her parents over for dinner.

None

He was Mohawk-less and still discovering the local gym
None

She had braces, was on her awkward, pre-puberty stage, and still losing the last of her baby fat.

None

He was really surprised when he saw her dads
None

He was kind of weirded out that he was speechless for a while
None

He didn't really need to talk since Rachel was already herself then
None

She talked nonstop about her achievements, musical talents, the awards she has won, dancing, her dreams and goals
None

He thought she looked really funny, her face turning blue due to the lack of air, speaking five hundred words a second.

None

They were seated around the dinner table
None

Rachel's dads were on either side of her
None

She was going off about some Broadway musical, while he was playing with his food
food has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'food']

He looked at his mom and she looked really impressed by Rachel
None

He just rolled his eyes
None

She was in the middle of her extremely lengthy monologue whenâ€¦.

None

So do you guys like, do it? he asked naÃ¯vely, out of nowhere
None

He just couldn't help it
None

It kind of bothered him.

None

NOAH! his mom gasped out.

None

That was exceedingly inappropriate and highly abhorrent, Noah
None

Rachel said, glaring at him.

None

Huh? he was staring at her blankly, the previous subject completely forgotten
None

He looked at his mom, What the heck is she talkin' about? She's such a freak, mom
None

She hasn't shut up since she got here!And then he turned to Rachel, shut up already!

None

I am insulted by your rudeness
None

I will not be spoken to like that
None

She said, moving her chair back, motioning to stand up.

None

Rachelâ€¦
None

Both her dads chimed warningly.

None

She sighed and leaned back on her chair again, trying to control her growing irritation and annoyance.

None

Seriously though, who talks like that? he couldn't just let it go
None

He looked at Rachel
None

She looked furious
None

What?

None

I didn't want to say this in front of your mother, but I absolutely will not contain my opinion so she turned to his mother, I apologize, Mrs
None

Puckerman
None

she then focused her attention back on him, You, she raised her hand, pointing a small finger to his face, are the most insensitive, thoughtless, dim-witted, unintelligent Neanderthal I have ever met! Your idiocy and ignorance astounds me! she was breathing hard now, her face flushed.

None

He was staring at her dumbly
None

Then, he started laughing hysterically
None

He didn't really understand anything she just said, but the look on her face was hilarious.

None

She was gripping the side of the table so tightly that her knuckles were turning white
None

Youâ€¦ you jerk! she yelled in frustration.

None

He just laughed harder
None

Now thatâ€¦
None

I understand
None

He choked out in the middle of the fits of laughter.

None

At that point she was seething
None

She let out a (loud!) frustrated shriek, gave him a death glare, then ran out, tears of anger running down her face
None

Her dads just looked at his mom apologetically, and then left after her.

None

Noah Benjamin Puckerman!! his hysterics turned into a nervous laugh
None

His full name was never a good sign
None

He never saw his mom look so angry before
None

Go to your room
None

NOW!! she yelled the last part.

None

But mom! he whined
None

She was totally weird! That's not my fault! he tried to listen out.

None

If you want to see the light of day again, Noah, I suggest you go straight to your room right now
None

she threatened.

None

He swallowed hard
None

She never got this mad at him before; not even when he broke this guy and his mom up on purpose, just because his mom didn't make him dinner (ONCE!) when she was dating him
None

She really liked the guy
None

That said a lot about their relationship.

None

When he still didn't make a move to go, she yelled NOW!

None

He made a mad dash for his room, at that.

None

The next day, his mom dragged him to the front door of the Berrys' gigantic house
None

Their house was the largest of all the houses on their street.

None

MOM! Please!! Don't do this to me! He cried desperately
None

He was trying to pull himself out of her grasp.

None

Don't make this worse than it is, Noah
None

She said calmly
None

Do you want your freedom back or not? she then rang the door bell.

None

They rang a couple of times more until slowly, one of the huge double doors opened, and then there she was, in her all pink outfit
None

She smiled brightly when she saw his mom
None

Her face fell, however when his mom tugged him from behind her, so they were awkwardly standing in front of each other.

None

Ummâ€¦ hi Mrs
None

Puckerman
None

She said softly.

None

Hi Rachel, Noah wants to tell you something
None

She said, pushing her son forward, so they were too close for his liking.

None

It took a full minute before he looked at his mom, to see her glaring at him, urging him to talk
None

He sighed dramatically, and then nervously faced her
None

he wasn't really good at apologizing, just because he doesn't do sorry.

None

I uhhhâ€¦.
None

I'm sorry
None

He said hesitantly, and then he turned away from her
None

He was looking for a way to escape, then tried running in some random direction, but his mom stopped him and twisted him around to face her yet again.

None

Sorry for whatâ€¦ His mom urged
None

He rolled his eyes at her, but went with it anyways.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

He sighed
None

Sorry for calling you a freak and laughing at you
None

He looked at her, the look of confusion on her face, replaced by a smile.

None

I apologize too, for my behavior last night
None

My temper got the best of me
None

She said, the smile still in place.

None

He returned her smile, then he looked at his mom, as if to question her if he did alright
None

A look of satisfaction was painted across her face
None

She nodded; he took that as a 'yes' and a go signal, and rushed to his house without even sparing her a last glance.

None

He was fifteen and she was fourteen
None

He was now semi-ripped, thanks to the gym and football
None

He was a chick magnet, he called himself a 'stud', to which no one really disagrees to, and the Mohawk was born
None

She made her dads buy her the elliptical, and just started the chasing her goals ritual
None

She finally got her braces taken out, she was starting to grow into her body, and she just got her bellybutton pierced.

None

They didn't really talk at all, besides the 'special' (stupid) dinners his mom and her dads schedule once a month
None

There, they had to interact, which wasn't really that bad, except for her usual 'solo-psycho-babble' as he kindly puts it
None

He still thought she was weird, and the way she talked still freaked him out
None

He thanked God his mom was there to translate
None

Not that he actually pay attention to her
None

Because he really didn't.

None

Not until one fateful night.

None

The windows of their rooms were right across from each other
None

He was trying to open his window, one hot summer night, when he noticed her
None

She forgot to close her curtains.

None

She was facing the side, probably where her mirror was, only in her underwear, hairbrush in hand, singing
None

He could hear her voice faintly
None

He cracked the window open all the way, and he heard it much clearly.

None

He knew she could sing, mostly because he heard part of her 'solo-psycho-babble' one night
None

She was talking, or more like bragging about her voice
None

Her dads didn't seem to hint that she was full of herself, so she had to be telling the truth
None

He never actually heard her sing after all of those years of dinners
None



None

 He thought.

None

That night was when he first heard her sing
None

He was mesmerized
None

She had a great voice, but he wasn't really focusing on that anymore.

None

He couldn't keep his eyes off her
None

They wondered over the exposed tanned skin
None

He almost didn't recognize her, comparing this sight to her bland taste in clothes.
None



None

He thought while staring her down
None

She was doing some type of dance when she faced him, he thought she was looking at him, his heart skipped a beat, and then she turned her head to the side again
None

He let out a breath of relief.

None

His eyes traveled downward following her hands as they traced her toned stomach
None

His eyes automatically stopped when he spotted a tiny diamond
None



None

he was shocked, yet completely turned on
None

He groaned
None

He needed a cold shower bad, at the moment, so he glanced at her once more, and ran to the bathroom.

None

He found out the next evening, to his delight, that she didn't actually forget to close the curtains
None

She purposely leaves it open
None

He was in heaven.

None

This became a hobby of his
None

Every night, at about nine o'clock, he would place a chair in front of his window and he would just lean back, relax and enjoy the show
None

But it always ended the same
None

A cold shower.

None

All he could think about the next day, is a certain little diamond piercing.

None

Then one day, while she was in the middle of a dance, he decided, just like that, that she was HIS
None

But that definitely does not mean he liked her.

None

He met Finn just about the same time he met Rachel
None

He only invited him over when she was out.

None

At first, it was just because their ages were close, so she would probably want to join in, plus, there was a huge possibility that Finn would invite her to join them.

None

But after The Decision, he no longer invited Finn over for obvious reasons
None

He did not want to share
None

He didn't want to share HER with anyone.

anyone has no Synonyms in the API
None

He was pretty sure she'd like Finn
None

Everyone liked Finn.

None

That still didn't mean he liked her
None

He was just that possessive with the things that belonged to him.

None

It was the first day of his sophomore year
None

He walked down the hall to get a slushie from the cafeteria, as he did every day the year before.

None

After he got one, cherry flavored, he continued walking down the hall, and was greeted by random people
None

Some hi-fiving him, some girls winking at him
None

The usual.

None

He did not expect the next thing though- Rachel Berry, standing in front of a locker, twisting the knob, trying out the combination
None

He was horrified.

None

He was even more horrified when Finn's locker was just four lockers down from hers
None

He immediately relaxed when his girlfriend, cheerio captain, Quinn Fabray, AKA school slut, was hanging on to his side.

None

Rachel seemed to notice him staring at her; she looked up, and gave him a warm smile.

None

He had to do something
None

Fast
None

That's when it clicked
None

Slushie in hand plus girls' bathroom at the far end of the hall equals people not knowing him and Rachel knew each other and immediately gapping their social status
None

This also meant guys won't ask her out
None

The last part was his personal favorite.

None

Him, owning her doesn't mean he doesn't think she's a loser who can potentially ruin his reputation.

None

It was like the world was in slow motion when he threw the icy refreshment forward, its contents racing out of the cup
None

The expression on her face changed from question, to surprise, to realization, to hurt, in a matter of seconds
None

The frosty liquid was oozing down her face to her white clean shirt
None

Tears started to mix with the red icy substance
substance has no Synonyms in the API
['mix', 'with', 'substance']

Then, she ran to the bathroom, trying to push her way through the laughing crowd.

None

He just stood there for a second, until everyone started chanting his name and cheering
None

His popularity points just went up
None

Her non-existent one apparently will be non-existent for a long time.

None

Her curtains were closed that night, for the first time since he started his'hobby'.

None

The school discovering her MySpace was a huge mistake
None

It didn't take long until she was the official laughing stock of the whole school.

None

She was now the outcast
None

It went on like this all her freshman year.

None

The cheerios were the masterminds of this torture, his slushies just added to her misery
None

She was now their entertainment
None

They laughed at her, insulted her; they even went as far as drawing pornographic pictures of her on the girls' bathroom walls
None

That was just low, in his opinion.

None

Puck was (pleasantly) surprised when everything that was going on didn't seem to affect her
None

He was even more surprised when she didn't tell her dads what he did to her at school
None

She acted normally, when in their traditional dinners
None

She was stronger than he thought.

None

He does not like her
None

he was now trying to persuade himself that.

None

It was the beginning of his junior year, when glee emerged out of nowhere.

None

She was the first one to sign up, of course, with the gold star and all
star has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'star']

She immediately became the female lead singer
None

That didn't surprise him at all
None

The 'underdogs' too, joined in, which also wasn't a surprise.

None

What surprised, appalled, and sickened him all at the same time was his best friend, football captain, co-most-popular guy at McKinley High, boyfriend of Quinn Fabray, joined in too.

None

He was at once partnered with Rachel, and almost immediately too, she fell in love with him
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

he was pissed
None

Extremely pissed.

None

She was following Finn around like a love-sick puppy, which only added to his irritation.

None

She was supposed to be his, DAMN IT!!

None

He was exceedingly mad at Finn
None

Apparently, Quinn was pissed too
None

Everyone knows (except for Finn), that if Quinn Fabray was mad, half the guy population in school got lucky.

None

He was one of them
None

What can he say? He's a red-blooded always- horny teen aged boy
None

That was like physically impossible to resist
None

Plus, he was mad at Finn for stealing her.

None

That was a huge mistake.

None

Quinn came to him four weeks later, when she found out she was pregnant
None

He said he would take care of the baby, because he didn't want to be like his dead beat father
None

All she did was call him a Lima-loser and went back to Finn
None

She told him about the baby
None

The idiot believed you could get a girl pregnant in a hot tub, without actually doing it.

None

If he was upset, Rachel was shaken up.

None

At first, she was confused, and then mad, mostly at Finn, then, she just cracked
None

She had gone into the deep end
None

She didn't talk to anyone
None

Even the glee kids.

None

She began to change
None

He didn't like it
None

She won't even open the curtains anymore
None

The light to her room was permanently closed
None

He waited anyways
None

He was, Dare he say, a little worried.

None

He fell asleep while waiting once, leaning against the window
None

He woke up in the middle of the night, and caught her staring blankly at nowhere in particular, the moon illuminating her face
None

She looked sad
None

Then her shoulders started shaking, her head on her hands.

None

He watched her as she stood up, let out a heavy sigh and closed the curtain completely
None

He was really missing her singing and dancing
None

He was also kind of, just a tiny, little bit, maybe, missing her and her not so little speeches
None

Just at the slightest.

None

Many months had passed, Rachel was still deep in her never-ending despair, but her eyes were no longer puffy in the mornings, not like before, when it seemed like it was every day, she cried whenever she was alone.

None

He caught her once or twice, maybe more, but he just left her there
None

He couldn't get the courage to be there, with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

He just walked away.

None

He had to come to school for football practice, early one morning
None

It was still dark outside, when he saw her
None

She had a large duffel bag on her shoulder, a, what seemed like a pillow on one hand, and another bag on the other hand.

None

He watched her yet again, as she loaded the stuff in the backseat of her car and entered and sat on the driver's seat
None

He studied her features
None

Her face was all twisted; it was like she was trying to make the most important decision of her life
None

She sat there for at least ten minutes, with her hand on the steering wheel, eyes fixed ahead.

hand has no Synonyms in the API
['sit', 'with', 'hand']

She took a final fleeting look at her house, started the car, and drove off.

None

He decided to follow her, so he ran into his house, to his room, emptied his school backpack and threw random clothes in it
None

He grabbed his wallet on the nightstand
None

He took the stuff and tripped a couple of times, in his hustle
None

He did all that in barely two minutes.

None

He then got in the truck in record time
None

It was too early in the morning, so there was no harm in breaking some traffic regulations
None

He broke at least five
None

He didn't care
None

He was just trying to find her.

None

He finally caught up with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

He made a pact with himself: it didn't matter where she went; it didn't matter how long it took, he's going to be with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Even without her knowing he's there
None

That's what you do when you loved someone right?

None

Wait, wait, wait, He loved her!? 

None

 he thought
None

For the first time in his young life, he was completely and utterly confused with himself
None

He didn't even like her, the last time he checked!

None

Oh! What has this world come to?!

None

It was a cloudless day
None

The golden sun was shining brightly against the perfectly blue sky
None

It was a contrast with the gray clouds that roofed it the day before
None

The birds were chirping happily
None

There was a breeze blowing softly in the meadow by the road
None

The scene was just perfect.

None

Sunlight was peeking through the car windows, bathing the two bodies, molded together perfectly, with warmth
warmth has no Synonyms in the API
None

They were still sound asleep, Rachel still in her sensible underwear and Puck still shirtless
None

His letterman jacket forgotten, on the floor.

None

Somehow, they shifted positions while in their slumber
None

Now, they were both on their sides, Rachel on the edge
None

The only thing that kept her from falling to the floor was his strong arm supporting all her weight
None

She was using his other arm as a pillow, his fingers, somehow, entwined with hers
arm has no Synonyms in the API
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Their legs still entangled.

None

One would think they were lovers.

None

She was the first one to wake
None

The first thing she grasped in her semi-conscious state was the fact that she was in someone's (muscular, she noted) arms
None

She stirred a little; his grip seemed to tighten when she did so.

None

She was extremely confused
None

She tried to pull away to look at the person's face, when she realized her hand was interlaced with his
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She tried to detangle her fingers with his, but he seemed to refuse to let go.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was starting to feel the rapidly growing uneasiness, when the even greater realization came over her
None

Her state of dress, or her state of undress to be precise
None

She could feel a hard, warm chest pressed against her back
None

She tried to withdraw herself from him again, but when he buried his face against her neck, she couldn't stop the shiver that surged through her body.

None

She started to seriously freak out when the events from the previous night came flooding through her brain
None

She was fully conscious now
None

She tried to wake him up by squeezing the hand that was intertwined with hers
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

When he didn't respond, she patted his arm with her free hand
hand has no Synonyms in the API
['pat', 'arm', 'with', 'hand']

When he remained unresponsive, she started slapping his arm with more force.

force has no Synonyms in the API
['slap', 'arm', 'with', 'force']

She was starting to doubt that he was alive
None

The only thing that told her that he was, was the fact that he was warm, and feels nice, plus, she could also feel a faint heartbeat on her back
None

Or maybe that was hers
None

She was in fact in the state of shock
None

She wondered where the heck her voice went.

None

She was amidst her thoughts when she heard a light tap on the window.

None

She was so surprised that she let out an awfully loud scream, and yanked herself out of his arms
None

He instantaneously woke up at that, a frightened look slapped across his features
None

They were on opposite ends of the cab now.

None

They both were breathing heavily, staring intently at each other
None

Well, she was staring intently at him; he was staring intently at her body
None

She instantly felt self conscious
None

He seemed to realize what he was doing, and immediately averted his eyes from her, his gaze, landing on his jacket sprawled on the floor
None

He grabbed the material and tossed it to her in one swift move.

None

It was silent for a couple of seconds
None

The longest seconds of her life, she might add
None

He opened his mouth to say something when they heard another set of tapping
None

They both snapped their heads to look at the source of the sound.

None

Shit! He whispered
None

Puck looked over Rachel
None

Her face was as red as the first slushie (cherry) he threw at her face.

None

It was a policeman with the sunglasses, helmet, badge and all
None

Her heart was hammering in her chest
None

She didn't know if it was from nervousness, the suddenness of it all, or the fact that she and Puck slept together
None

Literally of course, but still.

None

The officer motioned for Puck to go to the driver's seat
None

Puck gave Rachel another look then complied.

None

He rolled down the window of his truck
None

Sup officer? he said in a casual Puck-ish manner.

None

Young man, this is not the right place to beâ€¦ummâ€¦
None

foolin' around with your lady friend
None

It distracts the travelers that pass by
None

The officer said authoritatively.

None

Rachel gasped at the officer's words.

None

Do you see anyone here? Coz' I sure don't
None

Puck replied calmly, and somewhat sarcastically.

None

We most certainly were not 'fooling around'! Rachel protested from the back seat.

None

The officer just gave her a 'do I look stupid to you?' look and gestured to what her and puck were wearing, or not wearing for that matter
None

She also realized that the officer had caught them in their not so innocent sleeping arrangement some minutes ago
None

She didn't have an explanation for that, so she just slumped back down on her seat, sighing in defeat.

None

Puck twisted around to look at her, a wicked smirk playing on his lips, wiggling his eyebrows up and down suggestively
None

Rachel just gave him a mixture of a death glare and a look of disgust
None

He chuckled, which made her even angrier
None

She was trying really hard to hold back a colorful set of words just for him.

None

Relax Berry
None

He said, in a pseudo casual manner
None

He was laughing hysterically in the inside
None

For the second time in the short period they were awake, they were having a staring contest
None

This time, she was glaring at him, and he was laughing at her discomfort, with his eyes.

eye has no Synonyms in the API
['laugh', 'with', 'eye']

The officer cleared his throat and again, they gave him their undivided attention
None

You done denyin', darlin'? Rachel looked at the officer frowningly, puck's shoulders were shaking slightly
None

He was trying to control his laughter, a little chuckle came out
None

The officer just looked at him oddly
None

Now, where are you kids from, anyway? the officer questioned
None

Your parents might be worried sick about you
None

He added.

None

Rachel stiffened at the mention of her parents
None

Images of her dads worrying and freaking out flashed through her mind
None

She, right away, felt a wave of guilt go through her
None

But her mind was entirely made up
None

She didn't want to go homeâ€¦ yet
None

She was just beginning her trip for crying out loud!

None

But Puck didn't know that.

None

Li-He started but Rachel rapidly leapt to the front seat and was practically straddling him
None

He threw her a 'what the hell?!' look, and was about to say just that, when she dove in, capturing his mouth with hers
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Her hands were around his neck pulling his face closer to her.

None

As the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures
None

She was definitely desperate at that time.

None

He was stunned! Surprised! He was so shocked at her sudden mood transformation, that he almost stopped the kiss
None

Almost! And almost automatically, his hands flew from his sides to her hair, he was intensely responding, fiercely bruising her lips with his
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Every coherent thought escaped his mind, except one
None



None

 He poured in every bit of desire for her those nights he saw her, in just that one kiss
None

He was getting more and more turned on by the second.

None

Then she stopped
None

Just like that
None

Just when he was too in the mood
None

He was enjoying that dammit!

None

They were staring at each other, yet again
None

Both red in the face, lips swollen.

None

She then turned to the officer and looked at him apologetically
None

His face was all contorted and was staring at them dumbly
None

Ummmâ€¦ sorry about that officer
None

You see, my fiancÃ© and I are extremely touchy, literally
None

We don't stop the urges
None

We just go with the flow
flow has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'flow']

She smiled innocently at the officer, and then she stared at Noah dreamily, then ran a small hand down his chest, which he shivered to
None

She suddenly remembered the officer's last statement, and felt the need to explain herself
None

So she did, or tried to
None

and as you can see, we don't need our parents' consent, because, we are getting married soon, we're at the legal age, because we're about to be wedded
None

Soon
None

We're old enough
None

She added again
None

Man, she was bad at this, he thought
None

 We just look young for the reason that we're taking these special supplements, so we always have our youthfulness
None

Don't you think we look young officer? Huh? Huh? So no need to contact any parents, or any relatives, or anyone! she was laughing nervously and a bit crazily if you ask him
None

Puck was still speechless, eyes concentrated on Rachel's lips.

None

The officer was tremendously confused about the extreme change in Rachel's disposition
None

He was gawking now
None

I.
None

uhhâ€¦ I see
None

I'm justâ€¦ ahhhâ€¦
None

leaving.
None

now
None

He stammered out
None

Then he turned to Puck, giving him a 'You are crazy' look
None

Good luck with theâ€¦.
None

marriage
None

Then he sprinted to his motorcycle.

None

They stared after the officer, as he hurried out of there like he was running for his life
None

When he was completely out of sight, Puck turned to Rachel, who was still on his lap, he noticed
None

Special supplements? Really? an amused smirk playing on his lips.

None

She glared at him and tried to get off of his lap, but he stopped her by putting both hands on either side of her hips and pulled her down slowly
None

The humor suddenly wiped out from his countenance.

None

What the fuck was that? he said, somewhat calmly.

None

Nothing
None

She gripped his shoulders while she tried to get away once more, but he stopped her again.

None

That was far from nothing, Berry! He was half yelling at that point.

None

Rachel looked like she was considering something, her features, thoughtful
None

Then she sighed
None

I didn't want you to tell him where we lived
None

He could figure out we're in high school and call my dads
None

Then he could send me back
None

I don't want to go back Noah! she said pleadingly.

None

Finally, he let her get off of him, he wasn't able to stop himself from staring at her long legs and her butt as she moved to sit in the passenger seat
None

Why'd you leave? he inquired calmly, looking at her.

None

She didn't seem to hear his question
None

How did you find me? she turned to look at him
None

Were you following me? she added.

None

When you're asked questions like that, the only thing you should do is deny, deny, deny
None

So that was just what he did
None

Hell no
None

he answered too soon
None

It was his turn look away and stare ahead
None

Why would I follow your crazy ass anywhere? he said, his words empty.

None

She looked hurt by his words
None

He knew that was the wrong thing to say
None

I knew you would say that
None

She said that with a small voice
voice has no Synonyms in the API
['say', 'that', 'with', 'voice']

She was in the verge of tears, yet again.

None

Then suddenly, she got out of the truck and hoped she was running in the direction of her car
None

The tears finally freed themselves and rolled down her cheeks
None

She was still in his letterman jacket, half naked, and she also forgot her clothes in his truck.

None

Note to self: never say the wrong things to a chick who cried herself to sleep the night before
None

Especially if there's a huge possibility you're in love with said chick.

chick has no Synonyms in the API
['be', 'with', 'chick']

He quickly started the engine and followed her
None

He drove right beside her
None

Ber.
None

Rachel, I didn't mean it
None

Please get in the truck
None

You're just hurting yourself! She was pretty fast considering the state he found her in the night before.

None

She saw her flats ahead, which meant she was in the right direction
None

The tears kept falling
None

She got to her shoes and put them on quickly, barely stopping.

None

Damn it, Berry! Just get your ass in the fuckin' truck! he was screaming at her at the top of his lungs now, clearly frustrated
None

Then he stopped the truck and ran after her
None

It wasn't long until he was carrying her on his shoulder; she was trying to wiggle out of his grasp.

None

Unhand me, puck! She yelled at him
None

She was beating his back with her fists for a short while, then she just gave up and sobbed against his hard muscled back
fist has no Synonyms in the API
['beat', 'back', 'with', 'fist']

Puck set her down on the passenger seat, she immediately let go of him, pushed him away, even.

None

Moments later, she calmed down a little, but the tears didn't stop
None

Just drive me to my car and you can go
None

She said bitterly to him.

None

He didn't say anything because he was scared to say the wrong thing, and spark the sobbing again
None

They drove for about five minutes, until they reached her car
None

He parked behind it, the moment the truck stopped, she practically jumped off and ran to her car
None

Puck sighed and followed her.

None

I can handle it now
None

I would really appreciate it if you leave me alone
None

Her voice not louder than a whisper.

None

Is there something wrong with your car? he questioned, ignoring her request.

None

She completely forgot about that
None

uhhhhhâ€¦ before she could say anything else, he already popped the hood open
None

I'm going to be okay, Puck, I know a thing or two about fixing these things
None

My dads taught me before I got my car
None

She said pushing him away from the front of the car, standing on his previous spot
None

She studied and stared at it for a couple of seconds.

None

The last time I checked, you actually need to be touching some part of the car if you wanna know what's wrong with It
None

he said, smirking at her again.

None

She glowered at him, then walked to the trunk of her car and retrieved a medium-sized tool box.

None

It's pink
None

He stated with a little chuckle.

chuckle has no Synonyms in the API
None

I can handle it now
None

she repeated what she said earlier.

None

Yeah right
None

He muttered under his breath.

None

She didn't seem to hear him, because all of her attention was now in the hood of her car
None

She tweaked for about five minutes, until she noticed him again
None

You're still here
None

She stated.

None

Well, I'm not really sure you know what you're doing
None

He said plainly.

None

She just sighed and continued with her work
work has no Synonyms in the API
['continue', 'with', 'work']

She twisted, pulled, and adjusted stuff for about another five minutes
None

She then went over to the drivers' seat and turned the knob once, then again, then again, then again
None

She went back up front, then tried to twist something again
None

She went back to the drivers' seat then twisted the knob desperately.

None

She screamed deafeningly, then she started bawling
None

Geez, she was too emotionally unstable for her own liking.

None

I'm sorry! he exclaimed almost instinctively
None

Did I sayâ€”

None

Noâ€¦ Noah, it'sâ€¦.
None

Theâ€¦..car! she was crying really hard and her voice was extremely high pitched at that point
None

Then she got out of the car, slammed the door shut, and slid down to the ground.

None

He checked the hood, then did the same thing she did sans the freaking out, then he turned to her, Your battery's dead
None

He said dumbly.

None

I know that, you fool!! Then the big picture sunk in
None

What do I do now?!?! I don't have a fucking car!! I'm not ready to go back to that wretched town!! She shouted, sobbing even harder, if that's even possible.

None

He went over and sat by her sobbing form, and rubbed her back hesitantly, then pulled back when she glared at him
None

Yes, I was following you
None

He blurted out
None

He mentally kicked himself for saying that
None



None

Her glare diminished and was replaced by curiosity
None

Her sobbing calmed down dramatically
None

Youâ€¦ were? she sniffled out
None

She couldn't believe her ears
None

Was this really happening?

None

You left because of Finn
None

He stated out of newhere, trying to avoid the subject.

None

Her eyes widened
None

Then opened her mouth to protest but was stopped by his knowing look
None

She sighed
None

You're right
None

I did leave because of him
None

That and the otherâ€¦
None

Stuff.

None

Guilt crept up on him, knowing he was part of the 'stuff' she was referring to
None

He just nodded solemnly.

None

Why 

None

you follow me? she pressed on the previous subject.

None



None

he thought.

None

I can come with you
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Trying once again, to change the subject, and he did, judging by the expression on her face.

None

She just stared at him blankly.

None

Rachel just sat there, speechless for a while, staring at him; he stared back, waiting patiently for an answer.

None

Then she blinked, as if the gears in her head had just started turning.

None

Her facial expression went from perplexed to back to when he saw her that night at her window
None



None


None

He kinda felt sick thinking back to those days, whenever he saw her in the hallways, at glee practice, randomly outside their houses, the monthly dinners; she always had that empty look in her eyes.

None

She tried to hide it at first
None

Whenever she was around other people, she always had that sickeningly fake smile plastered on, but it wasn't long until she couldn't take it anymore.

None

The smiles stopped, only to be replaced by a seemingly permanent expressionless stopped throwing the slushies when the faÃ§ade broke off.

None

He was pulled back from the memories when she finally spoke.

None

No, Noah
None

She said
None

Her voice was soft
None

We cannot stand each other
None

You hate me
None

You think I'm annoying, and my singing makes you want to set yourself on fire
None

She stated the latter with more hurt than she intended.

hurt has no Synonyms in the API
None

That was semi-true, if you asked him; he does want to set himself on fire whenever he hears her sing, but he meant it in a completely different context
None

He kinda missed her singing, and her voice, and even her solo-psycho-babble (which was whack)
None

He couldn't even remember when he'd last heard her speak like that anymore (It was way too long), besides her speech to the policeman earlier, but that was nothing compared to her usual
None

It was way too long.

None

Hey! Who said that?! he said
None

He was positive she wasn't around when he said that.

None

You
None

She simply said
None

I was there Noah
None

Don't act so innocent
None

We both know that's bullshit.

None

He winced at her words
None

Rachel Berry swearing? What the fuck?

None

I know for a fact that you enjoy tormenting and torturing the hell out of me
None

I don't want that on my journey
None

I 

None

 wanted that
None

Her eyes were beginning to get glassy again.

None

He didn't know why the hell his chest was tightening more and more as she spoke
None

Actually he did
None

Guilt
None

Lots of it.

None

I don't even know why you are here
None

Is this some kind of a sick joke to further ruin my life, Puck? She said, saying his 'common' name with such venom
None

Can't you just leave me alone?

None

he almost said that out loud, but he stopped himself before he could do the damage.

None

Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to leave my parents? To leave home? It was excruciatingly painful
None

I did not run away from home just to have one of the people I am running away from follow me
None

A tear rolled down her cheek.

None

He actually had the urge to lift his hand and wipe it off
None

But he didn't
None

It kinda hurt hearing her say those last words
None

He just remained silent, watching her mouth form more words, listening to her voice, filled with anguish.

anguish has no Synonyms in the API
None

More tears formed in her eyes, then flooded down, like a sudden rainstorm.

None

She covered her face with her hands, sobbing into them
hand has no Synonyms in the API
['cover', 'face', 'with', 'hand']

He, once again, tried to rub her back, but this time, instead of resisting, she accepted.

None

The second his hand made contact with the material of his jacket, which she was still wearing, he was surprised as hell when she threw herself at him.

None

He froze at this unexpected development, and then snapped out of it when he felt her tremble and sob against him
None

He automatically wrapped his arms around her.

None

For the second time in twenty-four hours, she was in his arms, sobbing
None

She was a complete and utter mess
None

Again
None

In front of the bane of her existence
None

But was he really?

None

God, Berry, Why the hell didn't you say anything? he whispered, then kissed her hair, I thoughtâ€¦
None

I didn't knâ€¦ I'm sorry
None

That just seemed to make her cry even harder
None

And that was why Noah Puckerman didn't do 

None


None

He always seemed to make a situation even worse that it was whenever he did.

None

So he stopped and just made shushing noises and mumbled 'I'm sorry's .

None

They were like that for a while, until she stopped sobbing and looked up into his eyes and asked the question he really didn't want to answer.

None

Why? He didn't know which 'why' she was referring to
None

There were a lot.

None

Why? he repeated
None

Wrong move.

None

Why don't you like me? Why did you throw slushies at me? Why do you all take pleasure in my misery? Why did you follow me? Why the hell did you offer to come with me? It just doesn't add up, Noah
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

she said that in only one breath.

None

I.
None

uhhâ€¦ He honestly had no answers to none of those questions, except for one.

None

He likes (perhaps even loves) her.

None

I like you
None

He blurted out.

None

Silence.

None

I am sorry Noah, but I am having a really hard time believing that, considering our history
None

You threw slushies at me, for no apparent reason
None

You don't do that to people you liked
None

You made fun of me, just to get everyone's approval and heighten your popularity, just like everyone else
None

You are just like them
None

The last part made him extremely pissed.

None

He was 

None

 like them
None

He fucking

None

 her!

None

She sighed then, put both her hands on his chest and pushed herself away from him.

None



None

She was half way up, when he grabbed her wrist and tugged
None

That threw her off balance, and she fell on his lap
None

She was straddling him
None

Again
None

(can anyone say de ja vu?)

None

You don't know what the fuck you're talking about Ra-Berry
None

he said, in a very low, yet very angry voice.

None

Before she could make another move to get away, he put a hand on her back, and the other on the back of her head.

None

Just like the first time He slushed her, everything was in slow motion.

None

Until his lips met hers
None

Furiously
None

She was motionless for a second
None

But she didn't last long
None

Her resistance broke off, and before she knew it, she was responding
None

Immensely.

None

For the second time that day, they were making out (big time)
None

His hands started to wander
None

One was under the jacket, playing with the clasp of her bra, the other remained on her hair then her neck
clasp has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'clasp']

She too, couldn't stop her hands from wandering
None

She was all over him.

None

Her hands were heatedly combing over his Mohawk, then down his muscular shoulders, then down his back
None

It was massively turning him on.

None

She started bucking her hips against him, which caused him to make this really deep, throaty groan.

None

He broke off the kiss, but his lips never lost contact with her skin
None

He was kissing along her jaw line, down her neck.

None

A car speeded past them and someone yelled Get 'em!! (A/N: me! LoL)

None

He realized they were still on the ground, beside her car, facing the road, so he place a hand underneath each of her thighs, just below her butt, and started getting up
None

She, instinctively, wrapped both her legs around his waist
None

He, yet again, found her mouth, and their tongues, once more, battled for dominance.

None

His other hand let go of her and he frantically felt his way for the handle of her backseat door
None

He found it, (finally!), and then opened it
None

He turned them around, and practically threw her in (that's definitely gonna hurt later, but who cares?)
None

Their lips parted for a second, and then he dove in and crawled on top of her
None

He looked into her lust-filled, dark eyes, and then smirked before he once again, seized her lips.

None

She gasped at his roughness, but she didn't protest
None

She kind of liked it, to be honest
None

For the first time in almost a year, she felt alive again
None

Like the world was just beginning
None

She was beginning to feel again
None

The numbness was starting to slowly, wear off.

None

She was pulled back from her reverie when he grabbed the collar of 

None

 letterman jacket, and then dragged it down her shoulders, viciously
None

They were back to their original attire
None

Shirtless Puck, and Rachel only in her underwear.

None

Her mind was dead (in a good way).

None

Then it stopped
None

This time, she wasn't the one who stopped it
None

It was him.

None

His arms were tightly wrapped around her
None

She was leaning on them, her eyes were closed, her lips pouting, as if, expecting another kiss.

None

He just stared at her
None

She looked so innocent
None

So fragile
None



None


None

She looked fucking perfect.

None

The damn guilt just couldn't leave him the hell alone.

None

She opened her big brown eyes
None

They were no longer dark, nor were they filled with lust anymore
lust has no Synonyms in the API
None

They wereâ€¦
None

Back.

None

The moment their eyes met, he knew
None

And he was pretty fucking sure too.

None

He knew there was no turning back
None

He was in 

None


None

As fucked up and as non-badass as it sounded, Noah Puckerman was head over heels in love with Rachel Berry.

None

It was in the middle of the day, and the glorious morning was behind them
None

The sun was blazing hot, its heat making the two tangled occupants the more uncomfortable in their current position.

None

So he awkwardly withdrew his arms from around her, moved to the opposite end of the car, and handed her the jacket
None

She took it and shifted her position, so she was facing the front, and hugging her legs.

None

They sat in an extremely uncomfortable silence for what seemed like an eternity.

None

She broke the quiet by speaking.

None

Okay
None

She whispered, while still looking at the head rest of the passenger seat.

None

He turned his head to look at her and asked, Huh?

None

I mean okay, I'm going to allow you to accompany me on my trip
None

She didn't really know what made her change her mind
None

Maybe it was the way she felt when he kissed her
None

It kind of eased the pain, and for the first time in a while, she felt like somebody actually wanted her
None

For the first time, she didn't think about the other boy
None

And she liked it.

None

He was about to ask why, but stopped himself because, seriously, why ruin a beautiful thing? There's still a huge possibility that she would change her mind.

None

Alright
None

So, we're obviously gonna take my truck, because your car is broken, and it could take days to fix that
None

This kinda shit isn't really my thing
None

So yeah
None

Where are 

None

going anyway?

None

I don't know
None

I just want to get as far from Lima as physically possible.

None

Okay
None

So let's get a movin'! he said kinda too brightly.

None

He held out a hand to her, with a huge grin plastered on to his face (he was too damn excited), expecting her to take it.

grin has no Synonyms in the API
None

She just stared at it for a couple of seconds
None

Then she looked up at him and smiled a little, and took his hand.

None

He moved back to the door and slowly slipped out, pulling her with him.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

But once the breeze hit her, she realized what her attire was, and shrunk back into the car.

None

I'm naked
None

she said flatly and self-consciously.

None

Half naked actually,

None

She rolled her eyes at that, I think it would be better if we first change into more appropriate apparel, before we initiate the transference of my things
None

She suggested.

None

Yeah, okay
None

He said, and let go of her hand to go to his truck.

None

Noah! she called out, he was already halfway to his truck.

None

He stopped on his tracks, turned around, and walked over to her
None

Yeah? he said softly, one arm on the opened door, and the other on the roof, peering down on her.

None

Umm
None

She coyly slid his letterman jacket down her shoulders, and tentatively handed it over to him
None

Here
None

Thank you for being such a gentleman
None

She gave him a small smile.

None

No problem
None

He simply said (he was hella proud of himself), then went on his way to his truck again.

None

It took them an hour or maybe two to move all of her stuff to his truck
None

Yes, an hour of double, triple, quadruple checking on Rachel's part if she had missed anything
None

Plus, they took all the gas from Rachel's tank, which was barely anything, but it still helped a bit.

None

After cleaning out everything in her car (cleaning was an understatement, she freaking vacuumed! Literally
None

The vacuum was pink.), he rolled his eyes at her when she went back and checked one more time, for anything that was amiss.

None

I think we got 

None

, Berry
None

He called out from the driver's seat of his truck.

None

Okay, I just don't want to leave behind anything significant or insignificant, for that matter
None

she sighed, and had a hard time climbing up into the passenger seat, so he had to lean to the side and grab her hand, so she could get in with ease.

ease has no Synonyms in the API
None

They were on the road (Finally!!)

None

Rachel watched as her car became smaller and smaller, and gradually disappeared through the side mirror
None

She loved that car
None

It was a birthday present from her fathers
None

Her dad and daddy
None

The thought of them made her heart feel like someone stomped on it a thousand times over
None

She couldn't suppress the tear that rolled down her cheek.

None

You're crying
None

His voice pierced the silence.

None

She painfully sighed, swallowing the lump, lodged within her throat
None

It is nothing
None

She said quietly
None

Another tear fell
None

She wiped at her eyes with her sleeve.

sleeve has no Synonyms in the API
['wipe', 'with', 'sleeve']

He ignored the stinging feeling in his chest once he saw her shoulders shake in the corner of his eye, and turned on the radio to his favorite station- metal
None

She didn't complain, just stared out the window
None

(He pretended that it didn't bother him that she seemed to be back to her depressed state).

None

They were travelling for about three hours now
None

It was getting dark
None

They passed by a couple of towns, but didn't stop because Puck didn't want to wake Rachel up
None

She fell asleep a while ago, and his stomach had been producing a continuous rumble chain that started halfway through the trip
None

He couldn't take it anymore
None

He had to wake her up, and fast
None

He's a growing boy for God sakes! He has freaking needs!

None

So he stopped the car, and gently shook her
None

Berry, wake up
None

shaking her again.

None

She stirred a bit, then opened her eyes
None

whaâ€¦ what's happening? Is there something wrong? she asked, her voice, slightly laced with alarm.

alarm has no Synonyms in the API
['lace', 'with', 'alarm']

I'm hungry
None

I need some food
None

He said, and at that moment, his stomach rumbled loudly
None

I'm serious, Berry, I'm gonna 

None

 if I don't eat within the next five minutes
None

He whined, with what she thought was a pout on his lips.

None

She rolled her eyes at his childishness, though a little bit amused
None

Okay, Noah, compose yourself, it is not the end of the world
None

I packed some provisions with me, don't worry
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

His eyes instantly lit up at that.

None

She went to the backseat and got a plastic bag out of the smaller carrier
None

She got a large Ziploc out, and went back up front
None

Once the smell of cookies hit his nose, he almost viciously ripped the plastic container from Rachel's grasp
None

She once again rolled her eyes at him.

None

He swore he cried in the inside when he took the first bite
None

It was soft and chewy and moist and sweet with little bits of heavenly chocolate dancing on his taste buds
None

It was so fucking good
None

He groaned in pleasure with each bite
None

It was like having sex but less dirtyâ€¦ and nakedness
None

It took him no time to devour nearly every piece
None

He was on the very last piece when he felt a tiny hand grip his forearm roughly.

None

After Noah unceremoniously grabbed the bag from her (much to her displeasure), she realized that she had her iPod with her
None

She didn't want to argue with him about the radio
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was too exhausted for that at the moment.

None

While she was digging through her things (and listening to him making inappropriate noises), she eventually found it, but when she pulled it out, instead of an iPod touch, she fished out her phone
None

When she flipped it open, she saw ten voice messages, all from her dad or her daddy
None

It was a little bit more than heartbreaking that none of her so-called friends left anything
None

Not even a text
None

None from 

None

neither
None

That just reminded her of the reason why she left in the first place.

None

So she just flipped her phone shut, and returned it, way down, deep inside her duffle bag
None

She didn't want to listen to even one of her fathers' messages because she didn't want to cry anymore
None

Maybe when she's ready, she will.

None

She finally found her the object of her quest, and went over to the front seat again
None

Her stomach was starting to grown really loudly, and she realized that she too, was hungry
None

Really (tremendously) hungry, she hasn't eaten in almost two days
None

So when she saw the scene playing before her, she loudly gasped, and before he could consume the single cookie, she practically leapt to her knees and grabbed his arm.

None

Noah! she yelped out.

None

He immediately snapped his head to her.

None

You were supposed to leave half of that for me! You inconsiderate hog! oh she was mad
None

She baked those the other night for the trip for 

None

.

I didn't know okay!..
None

Here
None

He pushed the cookie to her.

None

No, I don't want it
None

she said, still extremely irritated.

None

C'mon Berry, take it
None

I'm sorry alright? he said.

None

Well, it's too late now
None

I'm really hungry, Noah! That was supposed to be my food for three days!

None

What are you, a mouse?

None

She huffed
None

You're an insensitive, insufferable jerk.

None

Just take itâ€¦.
None

P-please
None

he offered once again, though he had a hard time uttering the last word.

None

Ughâ€¦ Fine
None

She roughly took it, instantly taking a bite
None

bur, urm shtill hurngerr
None

She said with a mouth full
mouth has no Synonyms in the API
['say', 'with', 'mouth']

She was so damn hungry.

None

Okay
None

We'll stop by the next town
None

He turned to her once again, I'm sorry, okay
None

He said once again.

None

You are forgiven
None

Can we just please depart now? I am starting to feel lightheaded
None

She actually did
None

She guessed, from the crying and of course, the lack of food.

None

alright, we're goin', we're goin'
None

He said, starting the engine
None

He couldn't help but be kind of worried about her.

None

Little did they know, it would take another two hours to reach the next town
None

They were taking the back roads.

None

Rachel was getting more and more annoyed by the minute, and they've been arguing for the past hour and a half.

None

Are we there yet?!

None

How the hell am I supposed to know?!

None

You're driving!! You're supposed to know!

None

You have the map!! Don't you?

None

They were both panting
None

Realization washed over Rachel, and she immediately turned beet red.

None

I ummâ€¦ I don't knowâ€¦ I didn't pack one with me
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She said, looking at her hands.

None

Are you fucking with me right now?! he stopped the truck in the middle of the road.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

I do not accept such language! Rachel said, while holding on to the seat's armrests.

None

Whatever, Berry
None

They just sat there stared at the sunset before them
None

So what now? he said while turning to her.

None

I suggest we stop arguing and try to find our way to the nearest town
None

I am still really hungry
None

She said, giving up.

None

We could've done this a while ago
None

He said
None

You just couldn't shut up
None

he muttered under his breath.

None

She gasped, hearing him say that
None

You! 

None

 just couldn't shut up!! she yelled, rekindling the heat of the quarrel.

None

Justâ€¦ Let's just go okay! he said, and then he fired the engine up and zoomed off.

None

Noah, slow down
None

She said while holding on to the armrests tighter.

None

He just grunted in response, and sped up even more.

None

Noah! You're speeding! We're going to get caught by authority! Noah! 

None

! she yelled.

None

He pressed on the brake pedal, and it made Rachel lunge forward a little
None

They just stayed that way, the both of them breathing heavily.

None

What the hell is your problem?! she shrieked out of nowhere.

None

He turned to her
None

Her chest was rising up and down furiously; she was looking at him with her (to him) crazy eyes
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Her eyebrows shooting up to her hairline
None

Her hair was kinda all over the place and her lips were pouting slightly
None

She looked like one of those models in those Victoria's secret commercials
None

Sexy as hell.

None

She shocked him out of him (kinda) checking her out by clicking her seatbelt open.

None

She hopped out of the car and walked along the sidewalk
None

She saw a rock and sat on it.

None

He watched her for a couple of seconds, then followed her out.

None

I knew this was a bad idea
None

She said, quietly
None

Just drop me off the next town, and I can ride a bus to wherever.

None

I'm sorry, again, okay
None

It's just thatâ€¦ Youâ€¦ I'm just sorry, okay, I was just mad.

None

Will this always happen everytime you get mad? Because if that's the case, then we are both not going to last a week.

None

Babe, the word just slipped from his mouth
None

He looked at Rachel, and she was gaping, so he looked away and cleared his throat
None

I mean.
None

I mean Rachel, it won't happen again alright?

None

She was shocked when the word left his mouth
None

No one ever called her that before
None

She rather took a like for it
None

So when he cleared himself, she was maybe slightly disappointed.

None

It was eerily quiet for a minute or so, until her stomach growled
None

Loudly, really loudly.

None

He snorted, and then before they knew it, they were both laughing hard.

None

For the first time (again) in an awfully long period of time, Rachel was laughing, like really laughing heartily
None

A while later, the laughing became chuckling.

None

We better go, Puck said, a gigantic smile still in place
None

We don't want you to die of ulcer now, do we? He mocked, while standing up, and stretching out a hand for her.

None

She just rolled her eyes and took his hand, a matching smile on her own face.

None

Puck pulled her up a little too much force, and she bumped into his chest
None

He automatically wrapped both hands on her waist
None

He muttered an 'I'm sorry'.

None

There was still a little bit of light left
None

When she looked up, her brain just seemed to shut down
None

Every thought just seemed to flee from her mind
None

His eyes were just exquisite
None

They were mostly green with flecks of gold around the middle
None

She was taken aback by the emotion behind them.

None

I'm gonna kiss you now
None

he whispered.

None

That seemed to wake her up from the trance that she was in, and noticed how close their faces became
None

Before she could think any further, their lips collided.

Heartbreaker

None

Rachel Berry thought that she would be upset for a long time after Jesse had broken up with her, breaking his heart
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Sure she had cried for a couple days, and had avoided him like the plague for the longest time
None

Weeks had passed by and she had come to the conclusion that she had been depressed long enough; in fact she was done with all the idiosyncrasies that New Directions had taken with her
idiosyncrasy has no Synonyms in the API
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Despite all of her flaws, she had come out shining, her voice boosting up the glee club to new heights
None

Yet she still heard the hushed tones, the hurtful nicknames, and the gossip about her and her dads
None

The Rachel Berry that had been raised to let it roll off her was going on sabbatical; no more Miss Nice Girl to bring up an old clichÃ©
None

A part of her thought about everything the old Berry had; conservative, comfortable clothes
None

That wasn't going to work this new image for herself
None

Her internal thinking was cut off when there was a knock on her door
None

She turned around to see her dads standing there
None

Hey sweetie, Dad and I are going to go outâ€¦

None

I'll probably go out too, so no worries, she said as politely as she could
None

They smiled lightly at her; still not knowing about the break-up between her and Jesse
None

A part of her flashed back through her short-lived relationships; Finn was cheating on Quinn with the little dates he set up and for the majority of dating Jesse, it was in hiding
date has no Synonyms in the API
['cheat', 'with', 'date']

The only other person she dated was Noah Puckerman and was the only one who was brave enough to be public with her
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

As she thought about Noah, she decided that she herself should have her own badass visage to protect her from the world
None

She had to have her own version of Puck
None

With a determined look on her face, she grabbed her purse and keys heading towards her car.

None

She looked in the mirror as she thought to herself, the old me would ask for help
None

Take suggestions for what was deemed socially acceptable, but she shook her head
None

Not this time, she growled, speeding up a little bit towards her hair salon
None

As she parked she saw her usual hairdresser Nadine
None

She smiled lightly, Hey Nadine, she said, slinging her purse over her shoulder, I know this is super short notice, but can you squeeze me inâ€¦ Nadine looked at her watch and then the time for closing
None

She was about to open her mouth, she saw something in Rachel's eyes.

None

Sure thingâ€¦it's just going to be and you then, she hesitated then questioned, is everything alright? She opened up the door letting the petite brunette in
None

Rachel bit her lip, and decided to tell at least one person about this plan.

None

Iâ€¦I am tired of people judging me and pushing me around
None

I feelâ€¦I feel I want this new image for myself, and the attitude alone isn't going to help me
None

Everything has to be different, she said in a determined voice
None

Nadine just nodded her head, and led her to the chair.

None

Do you trust me? she questioned
None

Rachel nodded her head; she was prepared for anything, she smirked thinking about getting a Mohawk like Puck for a moment, but decided against that.

None

As long as you don't shave it off, she said lightly
None

Nadine nodded her head, and began to work on her
None

Locks of hair were cut, and layered leaving Rachel with a new do
do has no Synonyms in the API
None

She played with the bangs she now had and smiled at the reflection
bang has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'bang']

She barely could recognize herself except with her natural big smile and clothes, she felt different.

None

Wowâ€¦you look amazing, her hairdresser commented, liking her handiwork
None

Rachel pulled out her wallet and she shook her head, This one is on the house, Rachel gave her two twenties, and thanked her once more before heading out
None

She then went to all the popular stores, and got more seductive clothing
None

The next day they were all going to be shocked.

None

The next day she made sure that her make-up was smokier than usual, and she felt a newfound confidence building up inside of her
None

She wore more modern clothes; normally would dub as slut-wear
None

She pushed down the uppity annoying Rachel, and brought the calmer collected version of herself to surface
None

She grabbed the heeled boots that Kurt had made her get the first makeover he did
None

She shrugged her shoulders and put them on under her jeans
None

She walked down the stairs, and was glad to see that her fathers weren't there
None

She wasn't sure how long she could keep the visage up with them around; she needed practice with her peers first.

peer has no Synonyms in the API
['need', 'practice', 'with', 'peer']

As she walked to her car, she already noticed the different looks from the neighbors
None

Normally they wouldn't even spare her a glance, but this time she got a double take
None

She shrugged her shoulders, and got into her car
None

Rachel drove to school, and parked her car
None

As she walked down to the front of the school, she bumped shoulders with none other than Jesse St

James
None

I'm sor-, he started to apologize, and she just looked at him with a pointed glare.

glare has no Synonyms in the API
None

Close your mouth, you'll attract flies, she said, re-shouldering her backpack
None

She left her ex-boyfriend openmouthed in the middle of the parking lot
None

She smirked as she strutted herself
None

She felt confident and sexy as she entered the school premises
None

She headed for Mr
None

Shuesters classroom to turn in a project
None

When she walked inside, she could tell that she had effectively surprised him
None

Just came in to turn in my projectâ€¦ also to drop off her backpack so she could practice the song she was going to showcase for Jesse at Glee
None

He doesn't know what he was missing, she thought to herself.

None

Wellâ€¦ok, he said shaking his head not sure what to say
None

She just grabbed her sheet music, and walked out of the classroom
None

She thought that Pat Benatar's Heartbreaker would do an excellent job in expressing the new image she wanted to portray.

None

Wellâ€¦looks like RuPaul finally got the hint to start dressing like a teenager, Santana said snottily.

None

Might want to put your crabs comb out of sight, Rachel replied, seeing the fine tooth comb in the locker
None

Santana was shocked into silence; not because it was true, but she had said it loud enough for most of the football team to here
None

This meant she was going to have to deal with them questioning her to see if what Rachel said was true.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

The petite brunette smirked as she got into the auditorium
None

As much she preferred having actual instruments, she was just going to have to deal with just the instrumental recording
recording has no Synonyms in the API
['deal', 'with', 'recording']

She didn't see Noah Puckerman walking into the auditorium; things were still weird since the whole babygate thing, and after breaking up with Quinn, things didn't help entirely with the image
quinn has no Synonyms in the API
image has no Synonyms in the API
['help', 'with', 'image']

He knew that Rachel normally didn't take the auditorium this early, so he could strum out a few songs before going back to the Puck persona he hid himself so deep in
None

As he heard Rachel singing, he couldn't help but stay and watch her perform
None

She was so lost in the lyrics and music; she didn't see him watching her.

None

As she hit the last Heartbreaker, the room seemed to vibrate with emotion
emotion has no Synonyms in the API
None

Noahâ€¦what are you doing here? she questioned, quickly wiping the emotion from her face.

None

I was just coming here to strum out songsâ€¦ he honestly didn't mean to eavesdrop, but Rachel hid her annoyance well
None

Instead of yelling at him like she normally would have, she walked down to him.

None

Well, go ahead and go do your thing, she said.

None

You can join me if you want to, he offered; it wasn't like he was going to admit that he was lonely if she said no, but she never usually passes up an opportunity to sing
None

She looked surprised for a moment before nodding her head
None

It couldn't hurt to practice singing once more.

None

That sounds good, she admitted, knowing his voice was getting better the more he practiced
None

What do you want to sing? she questioned
None

Rachel wasn't sure how much of the songs she knew that he did; despite popular belief, she did listen to more than musicals
None

He thought for a moment.

None

Barracuda, he said, its gonna be a little more toned down since its acoustic, but I think you'll like it, he murmured lightly
None

As he started to strum out the first couple notes, she couldn't help but think that he was trying to be a friend.

None

Rachel started to sing looking at him.

None

There was an odd look in his eyes, almost like he was also alone too
None

She took a deep breath before starting the next set of lyrics.

None

OH!

None

Back over time when we were all trying for free

None

You met the porpoise and me

None

No right, no wrong, you're selling a song- a name

None

Whisper game

None

Puck smiled at the girl, loving the sound of his guitar mingling with her voice
voice has no Synonyms in the API
['mingle', 'with', 'voice']

He started to throw his vocals in the background, and he almost saw Rachel smile at him for a moment.

None

OH!

None

'Sell me sell you' the porpoise said

None

Dive down deep down, deeper than

None

You.
None

I think that you got the blues too

None

All that night and all the next

None

Swam without looking back

None

Made for the western pools- silly, silly fools!

None

He was glad to see Rachel getting into the lyrics and music
None

This is one of the few times he had seen her genuinely happy was when she was singing
None

Puck grinned at her, as he started to strum faster.

None

As their combined voices rang out, he couldn't help but smile
None

Wellâ€¦ she said clearing her throat
None

It was the first time in a long time that she had felt a tickle in the back of her throat
None

That was fun, she admitted.

None

So Berryâ€¦ he started to question, tapping his guitar lightly, Is that offer for being friends still on the table? he asked suddenly
None

A part of her knew that this would be something this old persona would say yes toâ€¦but having one friend would be nice
None

Rachelâ€¦ he said, snapping his fingers lightly in front of her face.

None

Sorry Noah, she said, shaking her head lightly
None

Of course the offer is still up for grabs, she assured him
None

He was still shocked that she was using such small words, but didn't want to press the issue
None

Anyways, we have to get to class,

None

Come onâ€¦ he said suddenly, we can ditch a couple classesâ€¦lets go do something fun, he said with a smirk.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

We are not making out, she said in a pointed voice.

None

That's what you're saying now, he said with a wink, But I'm just saying, he said with a grin, lets just get out of here for a bit, she bit her lip lightly, and then nodded her head
wink has no Synonyms in the API
['say', 'with', 'wink']

He grinned and they practically walked out of the school from the lack of security.

None

 

None

Rachel Berry couldn't believe it; they had managed to sneak into Shuester's class, grab her backpack, and then they had walked out of school
None

Chill Berry, Puck said as they drove away from the school, you're acting like this is the very first time that you have ever ditched, when she didn't say anything he chuckled, you've never ditched before? he said, trying to hold back the snicker.

None

Nope, cared too much about class, she replied
None

Puck glanced at her, deciding to cut her some slack.

None

Wellâ€¦ he started, what's something you always wanted to do instead of going to school? he questioned, trying to see how far this persona she was pushing was going to go.

None

She shrugged her shoulders, What do you normally do?

None

Depends, he said, Sometimes I go home and smokeâ€¦but that isn't what we are doing today, he bit his lip, and then thought for a moment
None

Well sometimes I go to this old drive inâ€¦figured out how one of the cameras work
None

It only has one movie in it, but it's better than nothing, he said.

None

That sounds good, she said, still wondering if Puck had an ulterior motive for wanting to be friends
None

She pushed down the pushy Rachel and just went with it
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Let things happen naturally, don't make everything about me, she thought to herself
None

Puck couldn't help but worry about the young woman in the passenger seat
None

Granted, if there really was something wrong, she would have been complaining about it alreadyâ€¦.right?

None

As he drove them closer, Rachel began to get nervous
None

Its ok Berry, he chuckled looking at her worried expression
None

I've been here thousands of times,

None

Cut class a lot huh? she questioned, getting out of the truck
None

He nodded his head, not wanting to reveal the full truth
None

Soâ€¦what movie is in there? she inquired as she helped him set up the speakers.

None

You'll seeâ€¦ in all honesty he had forgotten the movie title; he just came here to get away from the drama of Lima.

None

He helped her into the bed of the truck, and grabbed a blanket from the back of the truck
None

Uhâ€¦thanks Noah, she said to him
None

He shrugged his shoulders, and sat down starting up the projection
None

West Side Story? she questioned
None

Its one of my favorite moviesâ€¦ she admitted, and Puck didn't say anything
None

It was one thing to do girly things with a girl, but not even getting to make out was definitely not something Noah Puckerman ever did
girl has no Synonyms in the API
['do', 'thing', 'with', 'girl']

As they watched the film, Rachel couldn't help but feel vulnerable again
None

It was definitely harder than she thought; putting up this cool collective front
None

She shivered lightly and pulled the blanket up to her
None

Puck moved himself closer, lightly touching her shoulder with his
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Puck just couldn't seem to place it; he was a stud, and he could get any girl he wanted
None

Ever since he dated Rachel those couple days, there had been a change in him
None

He suddenly threw his arm around her, crushing her to his warmer body
None

Uhâ€¦thanks, she said, as she felt comfort in his embrace
None

She was once again reminded how comfortable she was around him.

None

I wasn't going to break up with you, he murmured suddenly as the credits started to roll
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

You knowâ€¦I never really liked Quinnâ€¦

None

Whyâ€¦why are you telling me this? she questioned.

None

Because all she ever did was remind me that I am the biggest loser every five minutes when we got back together
None

You always had faith in me for some reason, he said
None

Not that I need the faith, he said, trying to keep his bad-ass intact
None

And I've noticed the new image Rachelâ€¦why can't this new image have me in it? it wasn't Puck that was showing, it was Noah
None

Plusâ€¦having a stud like me around solidifies this new image you are desperately trying to create, he added with a smirk.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

Youâ€¦you never really liked Quinn? she questioned, thinking about their debate when she had broken up with him on the stands
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

It was more obvious to her now more than ever that Puck was the only guy that ever treated her right.

None

Just cared about the baby inside of herâ€¦I don't want to be my dad, he said
None

Rachel grabbed his hand; it would be nice to have one person who actual seems to care in on this secret
None

Soâ€¦ he pressed wondering if he should put his own defense back up
None

Its cool Berry, you'll just be missing a huge opportunity passing up on a stud like-, suddenly she had shifted, and her lips were on his
None

He grinned into it, pulling her into his lap
None

They made out for a while, and he tried to move his hand over to the top of her shirt, and she pulled away with a smirk.

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

I may be different in many ways, but I ain't putting out that easy, she said with a playful wink

['say', 'with', 'wink']

She got up and saw him smirk back at her
None

She was slightly unsteady on her feet.

None

We'll see, he played along as he turned the speakers off
None

Soâ€¦ he looked down at his wrist watch, seeing that he'd normally ditch for another hour or so
None

Wanna make out more? she rolled her eyes, and turned off the projector
None

Before she could respond to the question, she let out a gasp
None

She tackled Noah making sure she and him were hidden from view
None

Wowâ€¦I like this enthusiasmâ€¦ he said with a chuckle, leaning up to kiss her

She lightly slapped him, and hushing him.

None

One of my dads is here, she snapped at him
None

This is probably the property he has been trying to sell, in the midst of her rant, he pulled her closer.

None

Ohâ€¦so that guy is your dadâ€¦he only comes every once in a while
None

He'll be gone in a few minutes
None

Don't sweat it, he said.

None

Don't sweat it? she whispered sharply.

None

You know you are really hot when you get mad, he said with a smirk, shutting her up

She opened and closed her mouth a couple times, and then just settled for a glare at him
None

He just grinned at her, and she rolled her eyes
None

Her dad's voice slowly drifted away, and when he was finally gone, her nervousness was replaced by a rush of adrenaline
None

See it wasn't so bad now was it? he said, smirk still set in place
None

She rolled her eyes, before trying to get off of him
None

Where ya goin Berry? he questioned with a light laugh.

laugh has no Synonyms in the API
None

She opened up her mouth to say that she had a test, but that would ruin this image she was desperately trying to hold onto
None

Instead she straddled him and placed her hand on his chest
None

No whereâ€¦ she said, smiling lightly
None

As sexy as she was being, Puck could tell that she was getting uncomfortable
None

As much of a stud as he was, he wasn't going to be an ass.

None

Soâ€¦you want to do something to make St
None

Douche feel like a dumbass right? he questioned suddenly
None

She laughed at the nickname that was given to her ex
None

At first she had despised it when she heard most of the New Directions talking bad about him behind his back because he used to be in Vocal Adrenaline
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

While she was deep in thought about her ex, she began to wonder why he quit Vocal Adrenaline; he would have been guaranteed a scholarship out of Ohio completely.

None

Yeahâ€¦yeah I doâ€¦ she said in a determined voice
None

Puck smirked; he was wheeling her in
None

Things may not have been great for the two of them for a bit, but things were looking up
None

Finn and Quinn used to be the power couple at McKinley High School, but wait until they see Puck and Rachel back again.

None

Puck smirked as he drove towards the school; he knew that just walking down the hallways with Rachel on his side was going to be a shocker to the whole school
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

He thought that they shocked the class before, but seeing Rachel as she was will definitely get things kicked up a notch
None

She had a determined look on her face, but knowing her there was a good sign that there would be a song lined up for St
None

Douche
None

Noahâ€¦ she murmured nervously as they came closer to the school.

None

What's up babe? he questioned.

None

Doâ€¦do you really think that this is going to work? she asked, still stunting her vocabulary slightly
None

He let down his defenses for one moment, and wrapped an arm around her.

None

You'll be awesome Rachel, he promised, and after seeing her confidence come back up, he slipped back into Puck
None

Come on, he said, getting out of the car to open up the passenger door
None

As they began roaming the halls of the school, the looks of shock and amazement on their faces was gratifying for Puck and Rachel
None

When they hit her locker, Kurt and Mercedes were waiting for her.

None

Where didâ€¦ Mercedes started, and then was shocked into silence by Rachel's new look and the fact that she was getting all close with Noah Puckerman.

None

Wowâ€¦this is definitely better than when I tried to give you a makeover, Kurt said, giving her a once over
None

Though I have to admit, I think you look better with longer hair and-, she cut him off with a glare, pushing them aside to get to her locker

glare has no Synonyms in the API

And you're back with Puck? he questioned, eying the self-proclaimed stud.

None

Oh come on Beyonce, he said to Kurt, you are just jealous you aren't a stud, he said, crossing his arms
None

Rachel hoped that this wouldn't mean that he would start throwing people in dumpsters again, or locking them in portable bathrooms.

None

You guys barely lasted a week last time you attempted dating-, Mercedes started, Its not like you two have much in common, she tried to reason
None

In all honesty, both Mercedes and Kurt were just thinking about New Directions and their slowly growing reputation, and not at all about the people inside of the actual club
None

If they were true friends they would have realized that she was clearly hurting.

None

And you two clearly know me? Rachel inquired, raising an eyebrow at the two of them
None

That shut them both up, and she closed her locker before her boyfriend wrapped an arm around her
None

They continued down the hall, and she felt him squeeze her shoulder, helping her calm down
None

As they walked towards their classes, Santana Lopez couldn't help but oversee what two of her fellow glee clubbers did to Puck and Rachel
None

She snorted; it showed how two faced most of the club was
None

Yes she was a bitch, but she made that clear as day with anyone she talked with
None

And yet here were the supposed friends of Rachel Berry being just as bad if not worse as her
None

She eyed them wearily, and then headed to class prepared to just let this go
None

That was the case until she saw some of the basket ball team with slushies in their hands.

None

She rolled her eyes and approached the main guy, and tapped his shoulder
None

She remembered him very well
None

Where are you guys going with that? she questioned.

that has no Synonyms in the API
None

Instead of answering her question he gave her a smirk, Come back for more of me huh? she stifled a laugh, Yeah well Puck and Berry think that they are the new it-,

None

And you think slushying them will stop themâ€¦or stop Puck's wrath? she questioned
None

He seemed to think for a moment, but shook his head.

None

He has lost his edgeâ€¦in fact you and Brittany have definitely lost some popularity ever since joining the gay fest there, she once again felt the urge to snort
None

He was definitely asking for it, and she wasn't going to hold back either.

None

She brought his lips up to his ear, If you slushy them, I will tell every single girl that I know how small your penis is from all the steroids you have been taken, she saw his face drain of color, you were in fact the worse lay I have ever had, and believe me there have been plenty of those, she saw him clenching the drink tightly
None

Are we clear? She questioned
None

He nodded his head tightly, and she caught up with Brittany.

brittany has no Synonyms in the API

What was that all about? she questioned, playing with a stray bang.

bang has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'bang']

I'll explain later, she said, dragging her friend to class.

None

Lunch came sooner than expected for Rachel; cutting more than a few classes definitely made the day go by quicker
None

Puck caught up to his girlfriend, and wrapped his arm around her
None

Hey, she said, smiling lightly
None

She felt way more comfortable acting with him around, but it seemed like a part of him was just doing this because he wanted her, in all senses
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

She shook her head, and then felt him turn her around in an embrace
None

He started to lead her to the table where he normally sat at; it had the more popular members of New Directions, sans Quinn and Finn.

None

You ok Rachel? he questioned, smile in place to try and not worry the group of friends he sat with
None

She nodded her head, Its gonna be fine, he promised her
None

Then he grinned bringing her close to him
None

Hey guys, he said to Matt and Mike
None

Rachel was nervous about sitting near Santana; considering their harsh history
None

Not only did the group of guys and few Cheerios not seem to mind them; they seemed supportive
None

That was definitely a first for Rachel.

None

Soâ€¦ Santana said, I know we haven't been nice to each other since we first metâ€¦but I got to admit, She said, you got some balls doing what you are doing, she said to the two of them
None

Rachel smiled; who knew that Santana would have a heart?

None

Thanks, she said grinning
None

She could feel the stares coming from Quinn, Finn, and from what she assumed as Jesse St
None

James
None

She decided it was best to just ignore them
None

They weren't important right now
None

She had never cared much about popularity, and a part of her still didn't
None

But the way that people were talking to her and treating her was definitely a breath of fresh air
None

Finn and Jesse approached them, Finnâ€¦Jesse, she said to the two of them, barely sparing them a glance.

None

Puckâ€¦what the hell is going on? Finn questioned.

None

What are you talking about? he asked, clearly not interested in what his former best friend had to say
None

He knew it was either going to be about him using Rachel or the stupid video she had casted the three of them for.

None

After that whole video-, Puck turned around, and actually laughed, What's so funny? She used usâ€¦she ruined her reputation, I sincerely hope she's happy, Puck continued to chuckle, and brought Rachel closer.

usâ€ has no Synonyms in the API
None

You and St
None

Douche are still mad about the video? he questioned in an amused voice, sure it was corny, but wow you two are really acting like children the way you are sulking around, Rachel couldn't believe it, Puck really didn't care about the stupid video
None

Go back to you playpen, he said waving them off.

None

Rachelâ€¦can I talk to you for a second? Jesse questioned, trying to stave off how pissed he was getting
None

She let out a chuckle and rolled her eyes, I'm seriousâ€¦

None

And since you self-proclaimed to the whole school that I'm a heartbreaker, why should I owe you a minute of my time? she looked up at him with an impatient glance
glance has no Synonyms in the API
None

She loved how flustered and diva-like he was acting
None

Now that she thought about it, he was pretty much exactly like her; except the obvious
None

I don't know what you want, but you got three seconds, she said sharply
None

Puck couldn't help but be proud of how much Rachel was at that moment
None

She was definitely getting more confidence with this faÃ§ade, but he had a feeling that she was going to be just like him on certain things; alone.

None

It was that moment that he decides no matter what she thought or felt about him he promised that he would always be there, even if the faÃ§ade gets dropped
None

Before Jesse had a chance to try and explain Puck grabbed Rachel's arm
None

Time's up, he stated, standing them up
None

Before they knew it, Santana, Brittany, Matt, and Mike were ganging up on Rachel's two ex boyfriends
None

Bye now, he said, and saw the two storm off
None

Puck took a look at Rachel's eyes and saw relief, and pain was still shining through
None

No one else could really tell how much Rachel was actually hurting
None

Another promise he decided to make to himself was to get Rachel to lose the faÃ§ade, and open up.

None

So before lunch ended, he gave Matt and Mike a look
None

They nodded their heads, and kept the two Cheerios occupied before they could see Puck and Rachel leave
None

Rachel...are you alright? he questioned, noticing that her hard exterior she was trying to keep up was cracking slightly.

None

Yeah of course, she said laughing lightly, why wouldn't I be? she questioned
None

He sighed; it wasn't like he was going to push her into talking about it
None

That would only get her more agitated; he did know these things.

None

Just checking I guess, he said, and then he pressed his lips against hers
None

Talking wasn't his strong point, but he always was able to show what he wanted physically
None

She smiled into it, and felt herself relax once more
None

She didn't know how she was going to survive the next few classes without Puck near to reassure her
None

She supposed that this was something she was going to have to get used to
None

In fact before that Puck even offered friendship and dating again, she had planned on doing this all on her own.

None

Rachel had successfully made it throughout the rest of the day without freaking out like she felt like she needed to
None

Will Schuester was late, and she thought now was as good as time as any to sing a song that she wanted to sing towards Jesse
None

She knew with the content of the song, she knew that the New Directions chaperone wouldn't approve
content has no Synonyms in the API
['know', 'with', 'content']

Jesse had his eyes on her since she and Puck had walked in
None

Her boyfriend looked at her wondering what she was doing as she popped in a CD in a radio
None

She set a glare at Jesse, and waited for the part to start singing.

None

She could see Jesse's face start to redden; sure they hadn't gotten as far as heavy making out, but it was still just as embarrassing
None

She could see most of the New Directions members start snickering.

None

The rest of the club started clapping to the beat, except Jesse
None

He was slowly preparing to make a diva exit, much like Rachel would
None

She took a look towards Puck and she saw the biggest grin on his face.

None

Puck got out his guitar and started to meld in the acoustics with the set music on the disc
music has no Synonyms in the API
None

She moved closer to her boyfriend, and she grinned as well
None

Some of the female members knew the lyrics and started to do background vocals.

None

At that point Jesse performed quite the diva exit, and Rachel couldn't help but grin as he did that
None

That felt good; granted she was a little worried she went overboard but after the look on the rest of teenagers faces she felt a little bit better
None

Finn had the same look on his face that he had on earlier, but she brushed it off
None

Now all they had to do was wait for Schuester to show up.

None

Rachel Berry had succeeded the impossible it seemed
None

She mused about her day as she drove back to her house
None

Her dads still hadn't seen what she had done to her hair, or her attitude
None

She was thinking maybe she should take down the front around her dads
None

She bit her lip as she wondered if they were going to find out that she cut a couple classes with Noah Puckerman
puckerman has no Synonyms in the API
None

They were going to freak out when they saw the boy she was dating
None

Since their previous relationship had only lasted a few days, she didn't even introduce him
None

She frowned deeper at that note; they were going to grill him like no other
None

People thought she was bad earlier about her critiquing their singing; they should see her dads critiquing possible candidates for people to date her
None

She shook her head; this negative thinking was going to stop
None

She was starting to grow up, and if that meant stepping on her dad's toes a little bit so be it.

None

She saw that both of her dads were home and she wondered what was going on
None

They were never home at the same time
None

She took a deep breath, and remembered the look on Jesse's face when she sang Chivas, and the day she had with Puck
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'with', 'puck']

That got her in a better mood once more, and she found her cool
None

She opened up her car door, and grabbed her backpack before heading into the house
None

She walked in, and headed into the kitchen to fix a snack
None

Rachelâ€¦ she stopped in her tracks
None

That was the you're in trouble voice, but she rolled her shoulders back.

None

Yes Dad? she questioned, grabbing an apple from the refrigerator.

None

The school called, her other Dad said in a calmer voice
None

Is something going on with your friends at school? he questioned softly
friend has no Synonyms in the API
['go', 'with', 'friend']

Rachel always talked to him when it came to problems at school; of course she embellished the truth about having tiffs with her friends
friend has no Synonyms in the API
['have', 'tiff', 'with', 'friend']

In reality, she really didn't have any friends of her own; not until today anyways
None

She just realized that she had always been lying to everyone; even the people who care most about her.

None

Skipping classes is out of the question Rachelâ€¦no matter what happens you stick with schoolâ€¦

David, her other father, Alan said, pulling him aside
None

You know how sensitive she can getâ€¦

None

And you two seriously need to get that I hear everything you two bicker about, Rachel replied in a cold tone.

None

Rachel Barbra Berry, David started to growl.

None

What? she questioned, So I cut a couple classes today, so what? I'm not the only teenager who has cut in the past,

None

So if people jumped off a bridgeâ€¦

None

Oh don't even get me started on that, Rachel shot back, her voice cracking slightly
None

She coughed lightly and before she knew David's face was sour once more.

None

Have you been taking care of your voice-,

None

David that's enough; this is only going to cause more yelling, he said, finally dragging his seething husband away from their daughter
None

Rachel let out a sigh, and felt herself rubbing her eyes
None

Tears were coming from them, and she couldn't take it
None

She put down the apple and walked up the stairs and into her room
None

She locked the door, and put a chair up against the door
None

She settled herself on her bed, and then pulled out her cell phone out of habit
None

There were a couple messages
None

She didn't recognize two of the numbers, but she saw Puck's number there
None



None

 She looked down at her phone then towards her door.

None

She bit her lip, and she knew a part of him didn't want to be at this house
None



None

 She sent a text back, and then looked towards the other texts
None

The first one said, 

None

She wondered what was going on
None

She looked at the next message and saw it was Brittany.

None

This was the first time that she had ever been invited to a party, and a part of her felt nervous
None

What if this was just some ploy to publicly humiliate her? She took a deep breath, and then found another text message from Puck.

None

 She wasn't going to argue with that, she just grabbed a heavier jacket considering it was much colder at night
that has no Synonyms in the API
None

She pulled the chair out and unlocked her door
None

She could still hear her dads fighting so she could sneak by them easily
None

She pulled on her jacket and snuck out the front door
None

Puck was there waiting in his truck
None

She walked over to his truck meeting with his grin
None

It deflated slightly when he saw the look on her face
None

She noticed the look and wiped her stray tears away
None

Thank god her face didn't puff out, or get red
None

You ok Rache? he questioned
None

She nodded her head, hoping he would just leave it at that
None

Rachelâ€¦ he sighed, deciding it was time to let Noah out and hold back his asshole tendencies
None

You aren't okâ€¦ he whispered, as she got into the passenger seat
None

Before she could go crawling back into her shell, he leaned over and wrapped an arm around her
None

She never got this comfort from anyone except Alan when gave her comfort after a huge fight with other dad
None

Rachel wrapped her arms around him, burying her head into his chest
None

Rachel knew this was only going to last a moment, so she took it for all it was worth.

None

When she started to pull away, he snagged her closer once more
None

What's wrong? he questioned, running his hand down to the back of her neck
None

He massaged her neck, and felt her slowly relax.

None

Iâ€¦ she was going to open up about it, but she decided not to say anything.

None

Its okâ€¦ he murmured, I'm not going to force you to open up, he sighed, I know I wouldn'tâ€¦at least not right away
None

Finn learned that the hard way when it came to me and opening up about my troubles at home
None

Soâ€¦I've learned through my past mistakes, so I'm ready when you are ok? he questioned
None

She nodded her head, I was going to take you to a little party Brittany is throwing, but if you aren't up for it I can make an excuse and we can do something else, he offered, still rubbing her neck.

None

It's alright, Rachel said, finally getting a hold of herself
None

Thanks, she whispered in an appreciative voice
None

She felt his hands wipe away her tears, and his lips to her forehead
None

He smiled lightly, and kept her close once more
None

So you said that there was some party going on? she questioned.

None

He nodded his head, Did you want to go? he asked, rubbing her shoulder lightly, We can do something else, he offered once more
None

It wasn't like Puck to do this, but he never got out of the shield he set up for himself very often so it was nice to not act normal.

None

Noâ€¦I think I'm alright, she whispered, then she decided to say, maybe next time? she asked shyly.

None

Sure babe, he said, a smirk coming onto his face
None

He reluctantly let her go, and restarted his truck
None

She buckled up, and pulled down the mirror
None

She saw her makeup was messed up
None

She wiped her face clean, and then reached out for Noah's hand
None

He lightly gripped it, and headed towards Brittany's house
None

Last chanceâ€¦ he said, as he slowed to a stop in front of her house.

None

Lets goâ€¦ she said
None

He shrugged his shoulders and turned off his truck
None

As they got out of the car, She found Puck had embraced her once more; holding her together
None

She smiled and wondered what the party was going to be like
None

It seemed lower key than the parties she had seen in movies, and she found herself grateful for that
None

He knocked on the door, and saw some of the Cheerios and some of the football players that used to slushy her
None

Puck squeezed her shoulder, letting her know that everything was going to be okay.

None

Hey Berry, Mike said; she wasn't used to people actually willingly talking to her
None

She knew that this was something that people did, so she smiled.

None

Hey Mike, she said, as she and Puck passed him
None

Santana and Brittany were looking through movies; she was shocked
None

She was expecting drinking games, and possibly humiliating teens lower on the food chain
None

This wasn't what she was expecting
None

She then saw two people who must have been Brittany's parents
None

Things then made sense and she smiled relaxing slightly
None

Soon they went up the stairs, and found that there was some alcohol stashed around the house
None

She didn't say much, and she felt scared all of the sudden.

None

Hey Rachel, Brittany said, we were just picking out a movie to watch
None

The guys wanted to make a drinking game out of the corny things said in stupid action/romance movies,

None

I think they just meant movies in general, but they'd probably get more shots out of the gooey crap, Santana said to her friend
None

She found that drinking really lowered her standards on guys, so she wasn't really in the mood for a bad screw
None

Once they picked a movie, she saw that Matt, Mike, and Brittany had drinks, but she saw that Santana and Puck had no drinks at all
None

She saw him flash her a smile; he wasn't going to drink with his friends while she was there
friend has no Synonyms in the API
['drink', 'with', 'friend']

This was a surprise to the rest of the group, but they didn't question it.

None

While they were drinking, Puck suddenly pulled Rachel away
None

As much fun as it was to see their friends getting drunk, he could tell that she was starting to get uncomfortable
None

Is something wrong Noah? she asked.

None

Nope, was just thought you were getting uncomfortable, he remarked.

None

I'm ok Noah reallyâ€¦you can have a drink if you want toâ€¦I don't mind, she said softly
None

He shook his head, and they went to the backyard
None

There was a hammock in the back, and he laid them down on it
None

Its so weirdâ€¦I didn't think people would be this niceâ€¦especially those who used to slushy me,

None

Iâ€¦I guess I should have told you they were here, he said softly.

None

I'm okâ€¦really
None

Its just going to take some getting used to, she murmured
use has no Synonyms in the API

For a while they just sat like that, rocking back and forth on the hammock
None

She felt her phone vibrate and she pulled it out of her pocket
None

Her dads were throwing a fit about her going out without asking.

None

Racheâ€¦ he whispered, is everything alright? he questioned, rubbing her shoulders lightly.

None

Just my dad's throwing a diva fit, she murmured, ignoring the calls and text messages
None

The glee club thinks that I throw bad diva fits, they should see my dad whenever they get upset about Dad putting out the wrong curtains, she sighed, and felt her boyfriend bring her in close.

None

You don't have to go home tonight, he said, sounds like you need a break from your Dads, he remarked
None

As great as that sounded, she knew that she should probably go home
None

She was about to say that, but then she heard him humming
None

She opened her mouth to protest, but he murmured, Just relax, he commanded lightly
None

Soon she found herself calmed down, and she was getting drowsy
None

Still wanting to go home? he asked with a smirk on his face
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

She murmured something unintelligibly, and found herself burying her body close to his.

None

Thanks Noah, she whispered sleepily
None

Tough girl act definitely went out the window when it was just the two of them, but she found that she didn't mind.

None

Santana had managed to pry Matt off of Brittany, and forced him to stay on the couch
None

Oh come on Sanâ€¦she wants toâ€¦ he wined.

None

Yeah, I'm sure she does, she snapped at him, Bring it up again when you're both sober, she said, pushing him down on the couch
None

She turned towards Mike, and saw him frowning.

None

Sorry babe, he murmured.

None

Its ok, get some rest, she said, and then helped her fallen friend off the floor
None

Brittany come onâ€¦you got to get up to your room, the drunk blonde tried to kiss her Latina friend, Not now, she commanded lightly
None

Brittany frowned, and then it became questioning, Is it meâ€¦.or is Puck actingâ€¦nice? she questioned
None

The Latina turned her head towards Puck and Rachel
None

He was being comforting, and not treating Rachel like some floozy.

None

Yeahâ€¦Britt he is, Santana said, Don't worry about it now, she said as she pushed her friend towards he room.

None

When the sun rose up, Rachel found herself pleasantly waking up
None

She hadn't felt this nice since; she couldn't even remember waking up feeling refreshed and happy before
None

She opened her eyes, and found that she was with Puck on the hammock

['be', 'with', 'puck']

She looked down on her cell phone and groaned
None

She was surprised her dads hadn't called the cops on her saying that she had run away
None

She was about to try and get up when she felt Puck stirring awake beneath her
None

He tightened his arms around her, and brought her closer
None

Noahâ€¦ she whispered, trying to wake up her boyfriend
None

Noahâ€¦

None

Rachel, he murmured, it's Saturday, he reminded her
None

You got to learn how to relax, She started to fidget more, and he opened his eyes
None

Rachelâ€¦ he tried once more, and when she wouldn't stop it, he turned her around
None

Then he pressed a kiss to her lips
None

Instantly she wasn't trying to get out of his arms, and wrapped her arms around his neck
None

Much better, he murmured
None

She pulled away and he finally opened his eyes.

None

Noah, my Dads are throwing a huge fit, she whispered; she was more afraid of her dads when they were both pissed, than getting a slushy shower from the football team
None

He looked down at her, and saw fear playing out in her eyes
None

Puck frowned lightly, and squeezed her shoulders gently.

None

Why don't you say that you are at a friend's house, and you just crashed? he offered
None

Maybe her parents would be more understanding if they heard the truth
None

She thought about it for a moment; it wouldn't be lying, it would just be forgetting to mention that her and her boyfriend slept on a hammock.

None

I guess it wouldn't be a wasted effort, she sighed, looking down at her cell phone.

None

It will be ok, he assured her
None

She nodded her head, and dialed her house number
None

It rang once, and David answered the phone.

None

Rachel is that you? he demanded
None

Rachel held the phone away from her ear for a moment before placing the device back on her ear
None

This was definitely worse than she expected.

None

Yesâ€¦its me, she said, trying to get her sugar sweet voice on
None

Alan could hardly ever resist the voice to back down.

None

Where are you young lady, I am going to get-, there was rustling on the line and she overheard a small argument before a voice went back on the line.

None

Rachel, Alan said soothingly, we know that you are upset with us, but will you please just tell us where you are? he asked.

None

I was going to tell Daddy that I went to a friend's house
None

We were watching a movie, and we all fell asleep, she heard her Dads say a few words to each other before the phone was muffled once more.

None

Alright honey much against Daddy's will, you aren't in any trouble
None

Just let us know the next time you are going to a friend's house ok? he questioned.

None

Ok Dad, she said, love you, she hung up her cell phone and frowned
None

Just because Alan said one thing, didn't mean she was going to hear it when she came home.

None

That wasn't so bad was it? Puck questioned
None

She bit her lip and nodded her head
None

He knew that something was up; she was tighter locked then he was
None

That worried him a little bit; it wasn't like she had anyone to vent to
None

He supposed that her doing her Myspace videos was a way of venting, but after the horrific comments it didn't do much.

None

It will be later, she mumbled under her breath.

None

I'm sorry, he responded, bringing her closer to his body
None

I really wish there was something I can do, he let Noah shine through; hoping that would prod her into opening up about what was bugging her
None

She looked up at him in surprise
None

It was so weird to see this side of him; a compassionate side.

None

Itsâ€¦ she had to think of a way to calm down her vocabulary, That's very thoughtful of you, but I'm ok, she tried to smile her way out of it, but still Noah could see through her lie
None

After feeling a hand go through her hair, she sighed
None

Iâ€¦I never told anyone this, but if you couldn't tell my Daddy is really hard on me about everything, she said, playing with the end of her shirt
end has no Synonyms in the API
['play', 'with', 'end']

He nags at me every chance he gets; do better in school, warm up my voice, don't over do it, make friends, don't mess up-, she didn't notice the tears until she felt Noah's hands gently wiping them away.

None

I don't think my case is as extreme, he murmured, looking down in her eyes, But I've been a constant disappointment to my mom, he whispered, except when it came to holding down a job to help bills
None

With knocking Quinn up, and all the Cougars, not doing well in schoolâ€¦she doesn't say much, but just a look is all that does it, Rachel found herself looking up at him again
None

When they first dated, they never had conversations like this
None

In fact, with any of the guys she dated they never did this
any has no Synonyms in the API
None

It was never this kind of talking she was secretly craving for
None

The fact that Noah was comfortable enough to open up with this information made her feel like she did mean a lot to him
information has no Synonyms in the API
None

She hugged him tightly, not knowing what to say to that information
None

And then when she heard about me dating a Jewish girl, and letting her get away I didn't hear about anything else for a week,

None

Noahâ€¦ she knew that deep down, he still believed what Quinn had said about him; that he was just a Lima Loser
None

Wellâ€¦you got one thing that is going to make your Mom happy, she said, flashing him a small smile
None

He chuckled, Andâ€¦if you are willing, I'd be happy to help you with some school work if you want,

work has no Synonyms in the API
['help', '-PRON-', 'with', 'work']

Maybe, he said, Only if we get make-out breaks, he said, a smirk coming back onto his face
None

You know that I can help you with some of your problems too, he said, taking her hands
some has no Synonyms in the API
None

The closer you get to Brittany, he thought for a moment of his ex, and I guess Santana, they'll grow to like you a lot, he promised, not this new image Rachel, but they will like you, he promised.

None

Thanks Noah, she sighed, and then fell back into his warm embrace
None

Sorry about getting all emotional on you, she added
None

He shook his head; this girl was so smart but she was so dense when it came to social situations
None

Although, on anyone else, Puck wouldn't of had any of this emotional garbage
None

He just had to make sure that Rachel knew that she could trust him.

None

Rachelâ€¦as much as I love being the badass of McKinley High, I just want you to know that its alright to come talk to me about anything ok? he whispered in her ear
None

She nodded her head, and for once took that to heart.

None

Thanks Noah, she murmured.

None

No problem babe, he replied, squeezing her a little bit
None

Unbeknownst to them, Santana and Brittany had heard everything that was exchanged between the couple
None

Any other time, Santana would call her ex-boyfriend a pansy, but in all honesty that was the most open she had ever seen him
None

She had no idea that Rachel's home life was that stressful; the Latina felt bad for starting every rumor she did about Rachel
None

Brittany pulled Santana aside and out of earshot.

None

Puck was acting likeâ€¦ the young blond tried to formulate the words to explain what she saw, and Santana could tell.

None

Like he wasn't an asshole, she supplied for her friend
None

This is getting stranger and stranger by the moment, she looked towards the hammock and found that they were still there.

None

You knowâ€¦.I feel likeâ€¦bad, Brittany said
None

Between being hung over, and whatever meds her parents force fed her she was pretty messed up.

None

I know what you mean, she said, and she was thinking about Sue Sylvester
None

Lookâ€¦she gets a lot of shit at home, may be we can find a way to get her off the slushy list forever,

None

You meanâ€¦ Brittany was finally on the same thought process as her friend.

None

Make Rachel Berry a Cheerio, Santana said, And since she didn't get herself knocked up like Quinn did, it will be easier to maintain the stay away from her zone,

None

Wouldn't likeâ€¦.us being friends with her have the same affect? she questioned back
None

Santana bit her lip, and let out a low sigh.

None

As much as we want that, and on the off chance that it doesn't work out, she really doesn't deserve the shit she gets, Brittany nodded her head
None

Now they just had to find a way to break it to Rachel.

None

What if she doesn't like her idea? she questioned.

None

We'll cross this road if we get there, she said
None

As soon as they were done talking, Puck appeared with Rachel
rachel has no Synonyms in the API
None

Hey you two, we were just about to wake you up, Santana said, hoping that they didn't overhear their plan
None

Puck just nodded his head; he could tell the two Cheerios were up to something, but decided not to question it
None

Brittany's parents made some breakfast, at the mention of food, the two teens face lit up with excitement
excitement has no Synonyms in the API
None

Santana smirked inwardly knowing that she had them fooled for the moment
None

She was thinking about talking to Puck about it, maybe actually run it by him.

None

Now all she had to do was get with Brittany and the rest of the Cheerios to think about how to convince her to be a part of the team.

A few days had passed, and with the exception of her Dads still getting on her case about the overnight stunt she pulled with Puck
puck has no Synonyms in the API
['pull', 'with', 'puck']

She felt her phone vibrating, and she looked down and saw a text from Brittany
None



None

 She looked over towards the blond and wondered what was going on
None

Rachel wondered what was going on with the two Cheerios in the back of the classroom
cheerios has no Synonyms in the API
None

Suddenly her thoughts started to drift back towards Noah Puckerman
None

He had been checking up on her regularly, and surprisingly she found herself beginning to like this.

None

The bell rang, and Rachel was pulled aside by the two Cheerios
None

So what's going on? Rachel questioned, What is it with you two being so secretive?

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Wellâ€¦ Brittany started and then felt Santana pulled her and Rachel to a place where no one would hear
None

Rachel wondered what was going on; maybe she shouldn't have let in the two Cheerios on her little secret; granted, finding out that they had walked in on them opening up about their troubles, We were thinking about-, Brittany started to get confused again.

None

We were thinking that you should become a Cheerio, Santana said, cutting straight to the point.

None

Uhâ€¦why? Rachel questioned nervously.

None

Because that would solidify your status on not being able to get slushied, Santana reasoned
None

Rachel bit her lip; she was already pushing it without how much she was doing
None

Between the practice routines at New Directions, her dance classes, dates with Noah, and her parents lecturing her she had enough on her plate.

noah has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm glad you two were thinking of me, Rachel sighed, but I am not sure-,

None

Wellâ€¦at least think about it, Santana stated
None

Rachel nodded her head, and suddenly Puck was next to them.

None

What are you three up to? he questioned, wondering why Santana and Brittany had pulled his girlfriend aside.

None

Nothing lover boy, Santana snapped back
None

Puck rolled his eyes, and reached for Rachel's hand
None

She took it and squeezed his hand, trying to reassure him that she was alright
None

Well, its lunch we'll see you two in a bit, they zipped out of there, leaving Puck and Rachel alone.

None

Soâ€¦ Puck pressed, what were they talking to you about? he was hoping that they hadn't gone back to their old ways of being mean to Rachel.

None

They just want me to join the Cheerios, she mentioned.

None

Wellâ€¦as hot as you would look in those tiny skirtsâ€¦ he said a smirk coming onto his face, Its up to you babe, he murmured
None

It was still a little weird seeing him this comforting while still maintaining his badassness
None

She decided she would think about it; she wasn't sure how it was going to be if she just decided out of the blue to try out
None

It wouldn't bode well with Schuester, but then again lately nothing did.

schuester has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachel decided to slide this decision up to later, and looked at Puck's face
None

You ok? she questioned.

None

Yeahâ€¦ he murmured, still surprised that Santana hadn't given Rachel one of her classic Lopez death threats
None

San hasn't said anything to you has she? he questioned, knowing that she had given Quinn one when she had thought that the blonde was interested
None

It was really weird that she dumped him for having horrible credit, but still claimed him as hers
None

He just chalked that up to being the stud of McKinley.

None

What do you mean? she questioned as he moved his arm around her shoulders
None

She leaned her head against his shoulder.

None

I think she has gotten over the whole threatening girls-,

None

Well even if she did threaten me or anything, it's not like I'd listen to it, she said, snaking her own arm around his waist
None

He grinned and found himself not so worried about his girlfriend; at least on that front
None

Puck felt his phone vibrate, and saw it was a text from his mom
None

She had found out about him dating a Jewish girl again, and she was freaking out
None

She wanted to meet her; it wasn't going to stop until she met her
None

Who's texting you? Rachel inquired.

None

My mother, once again requesting to meet you, he sighed; hoping it wouldn't be a disaster once she met her
None

In all honesty, he wasn't sure how she would react to him being in a serious relationship
None

As much as he wanted to prove that he was changing for the better, it was going to be tough to for him to earn her trust in him back.

None

I don't know why you are so nervous, she said, and then thought back to the person she was suppressing in her head, and sighed
None

You think I'm going to be-,

None

No, no no, he said, rolling his eyes
None

I'm just afraid she is going to go crazy on youâ€¦and then go on about us doing i-,

None

You could just say sex Noah, she said with a smirk, knowing it made him uncomfortable
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

He just rolled his eyes.

None

I know that, but really this isn't something I want to discuss with my mother, he grunted.

mother has no Synonyms in the API
['discuss', 'with', 'mother']

It's a parent thing, she reminded him.

None

I guess so, he murmured
None

So, you sure you won't mind getting grilled by mother? he questioned
None

She laughed, and squeezed his hip again.

None

It's not that big of a dealâ€¦ then she thought about her dads, She can't be worse than my dads interrogating you
None

They have this whole little questionnaire set up to make sure that my boyfriend won't interfere with my future, when it was put like that, talking to his mother sounded like a walk in the park

future has no Synonyms in the API
['interfere', 'with', 'future']

Wowâ€¦I'm dreading that dayâ€¦ he knew that another time his bad ass image was going to get him in trouble
None

Granted, he never met the parents of girls he was with
None

While he was thinking about it, it brought up all the memories of the Cougars and girls he'd been with
None

He knew that was something that he was going to have to bring up with; he was going to be seriousâ€¦he just wanted to be sure that he was safe for Rachel
None

His phone vibrated once again, and it was his mom imploring him to invite Rachel over tonight
None

Mom is inviting you to dinner tonight, he grunted.

None

Wellâ€¦I'm free, she said to him
None

It would be better than listening to a recording of what Daddy wants me to do while him and Dad are out for their anniversary, she sighed; she loved her dads, but when it came down to it she was alone most of the time.

None

Alright, he was hoping that his sister would be over at a friend's house
None

But who knew; maybe they would get along
None

Just as a warning, my sister and mother will definitely ask a lot of questions, Whenever it was just him and his family at the house; he wasn't the complete asshole jock
None

He was just a big brother to his sister; and he found himself liking himself more as that person
None

He shook his head; that kind of personality wouldn't settle well at school
None

He looked down at Rachel; and started to pull her away from the school.

None

Where are we going? she questioned, snuggling into his side.

None

I don't know, he said to her, I was just kind of planning on driving until we found a place we would both like to eat at, he said, smiling lightly
None

She smiled back, and squeezed his waist once more
None

He was going to suggest ditching, but the way her dads had gotten the first time he wasn't too sure about it.

None

Soâ€¦are we going to ditch? she questioned, as they arrived at his truck
None

He still couldn't believe a part of him was kind of being the moral compass in their relationship
None

He shook his head, and gave her a grin.

None

Whatever you want babe, he assured her
None

The old Puck may have been nervous about whatever Rachel may or may not have planned, but he was going to just roll with it
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API
None

Ever since they started to date again, she had developed a sexy smirk of her own
None

It did a lot to the lower parts, and he grinned
None

She grabbed his hands, and started to pull him to his truck
None

For most days of the week, Puck had been picking her up
None

He may not be the Badass Mother Fucker (usually shortened to BAMF) he used to be, but he was someone to be feared if they hurt his girl.

None

His truck roared to life, and he started driving out of the school
None

Rachel bit her lip as she decided what they could do
None

She wasn't sure what to do; breaking rules wasn't usually her thing
None

She looked down at her clothes she had picked out, and started pulling lightly at the end of her skirt
None

She knew that no matter what Puck would be there
None

She bit her lip, and he gave her a questioning look, What's up? he questioned, as he started driving towards the fast food joints.

None

She brightened her smile, and felt her shell come back on
None

Just thinking about what to do, she said to him
None

Puck sighed, and then headed towards the theaters
None

As much as Rachel didn't admit it out loud, she was not comfortable drinking or smoking
None

So whenever he went out with her, none of those things happened
-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

We're going to the movies? she questioned
None

I didn't bring any money-,

None

We don't need money babe, he said with a smirk
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

I'm going to teach you the art of sneaking into a theater, he chuckled
None

In Lima, none of the staff seemed to care if you didn't have a ticket, so it was just saying walk in for free
None

She chuckled lightly, and found herself scooting closer towards her boyfriend
None

It'll be fun, he promised, trying to see the classic Rachel Berry smile come on her face
None

She finally smiled nervously, and he chuckled
None

Rache, if you really-,

None

I'm fine, she said, snuggling into her boyfriend as he headed towards the movies
None

Puck was glad that she was trying to be badass, but he didn't want to be pushing her if she didn't want to be doing this
None

Noahâ€¦I promiseâ€¦ she swore and that finally convinced him
None

We're still getting popcorn right? she questioned
None

Puck let out a laugh, and pressed a quick kiss on her lips before he parked his car
None

Like he said, it was really easy just to blend with the crowd to get into the theater.

crowd has no Synonyms in the API
None

So what are you in the mood for to see? he whispered into her ear.

None

Whatever you want, she said, as long as I get my popcorn, she said laughing.

None

Alright, he said, laughing along with her.

None

Rachel Berry let out a sigh as she smoothed out her jean shorts
None

She was about to go up in front of a whole bunch of girls that still terrorized her to this day
None

She had no idea why she was even doing this; she knew when Mercedes and Kurt became Cheerios it didn't have positive results
None

Before she could dwell further on this, she saw Brittany smile at her
None

The girl may be a little off, but she was nice
None

She felt a hand on her shoulder, and she turned around to see Puck standing behind her
None

Noahâ€¦what are you doing here? she questioned in surprise.

None

I came here to support you, he said with a knowing smirk
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

After taking a look at her face, he gently placed a hand on her cheek
None

You know that you don't have to do this if you aren't comfortable with it, he murmured
None

She bit her lip; she knew a huge part of her wanted this new image, but was it worth joining Sue Sylvester's group?

None

I doubt I'll even make it anyways...Sue would never want me here, Puck rolled his eyes, and rubbed her back.

None

Well I believe in you babe, he mumbled
None

She grinned and found that she was confident in what she was about to do
None

She wrapped her arms around his neck and placed a kiss on his lips
None

He grinned against her lips before she pulled away
None

He took a seat on one of the bleacher seats inside the auditorium where she was trying out for the Cheerio Squad
None

She took a deep breath before confidently walking to the center of the room
None

In the back of her mind, she knew that she was probably going to get hassled by Mercedes and Kurt for even trying out
None

She put that to the back of her mind.

None

From the bleachers, Puck was looking around
None

There were more people here than he thought there would be
None

After talking with Santana about the whole she had better not be setting Rachel up for a disaster, he was starting to look into other potential people hurting his girlfriend
santana has no Synonyms in the API
None

He saw Kurt was still in the Cheerios, and he really didn't look happy
None

The football player crossed his arms; he was going to have to talk with that diva later about his attitude
diva has no Synonyms in the API
['talk', 'with', 'diva']

He wasn't going to throw him in the dumpster; there were other ways to get his point across
None

When he glanced down at Rachel, she saw him smiling up at him
None

Puck smiled and waved at her
None

As soon as she started her routine, he made sure to keep an eye on how she was doing
None

There wasn't anyone saying anything offensive, so he kept his sights on Rachel
None

She was able to repeat whatever the Cheerios threw out at her
None

He was surprised that she was able to do all that after just watching once
None

He began to wonder why she hadn't tried out beforehand.

None

Sue Sylvester was shocked to see Rachel Berry trying out to be one of her Cheerios; she half expected that Schuester was trying to get spies into her club to get her funds cut once more
None

She knew that Rachel would be a great asset to the Cheerios
None

It was up to Santana Lopez ultimately made the decisions for the squad, she let her Cheerios have bigger reign than most clubs; not as much though
None

She didn't want another Quinn fiasco about
None

Alright Berry, we will get back to you, Rachel nodded her head, and walked out of the auditorium
None

Puck met her halfway, and wondered if she was alright.

None

You did excellent babe, he said, slinging an arm around her shoulders.

None

Thanks Noah, she whispered.

None

Are you alright? he asked, stopping them in the middle of the hall
None

She nodded her head, and found herself burrowing herself closer to her boyfriend
None

He knew that she wasn't going to open it up, and decided to let her be in her little world for a little while longer
None

You sure you are ok? he questioned, rubbing her shoulder affectionately as they reached her locker
None

She bit her lip, and looked over towards the Cheerios.

None

I'm not sure if I really want to become a cheerleader, she sighed
None

Puck smirked, and leaned up against her locker
None

He chuckled lightly, What? she questioned.

None

If you don't want to be a cheerleader, then don't be one, he said simply
None

Rachel had never heard that before
None

Everything she had tried she had always gone through with
None

It was how she was raised, her fathers always said that if she tries for something, makes sure she wants it
None

She just wasn't sure if she would actually like it, but that wasn't what she was worried about
None

Her dadâ€¦at least one of them, would get mad about her straying away from what goals that had set ahead for her.

None

I just don't know what I want, she said simply, not wanting to get into a long explanation like she would have done in the past
None

As soon as the words flew out of her mouth, she realized her big mistake
None

She was Rachel Berry; ever since she entered high school, everyone knew what she had wanted to be and where she wanted to go
None

I meanâ€¦ she started to stammer
None

Puck knew that this was going to lead to a classic Rachel Berry storm out, so he wrapped his arms around her and placed a kiss on her lips.

None

Don't sweat it Rache, he said after he pulled away, No one at our age should be so sure about what they want to do, she was shocked to silence at that moment
None

She never thought about it that way before; she never had the chance to think about it that way
None

Come onâ€¦ he said, gently tugging her towards his truck
None

He had picked her up for her tryout, so she didn't have her car
None

She was supposed to go to his house for dinner with his Mom anyways.

None

Quinn Fabray looked around as people filed out of the auditorium
None

What was Santana Lopez thinking, trying to make Man Hands-Berry a Cheerio? She may not be the Main Bitch of William McKinley High School, and she may have her times, but this was looking bad
None

Santana, she called out as the Cheerios started to exit
None

The Latina cheerleader turned around
None

Quinn remembered how Mercedes had gotten when she had become a Cheerleader
None

Rachel Berry would take it to the next level if she took becoming popular this seriously.

None

Hey Q, Santana said
None

A part of her missed having her friend back, but then popularity took over
None

Look we are really busy-,

None

I just want to make sure you aren't pulling a Latina stay away from my man thing on the Crazy-,

None

Since when do you care about her? I mean since you and Finnessa broke up, you stopped caring about her anyways, Quinn took a step back, no one had really been that snappy towards her since she really started to show her pregnancy
None

Santana looked at her, What? she questioned, just because you have a bun in your oven isn't going to make me talk to you any differently, The Latina rolled her eyes, But if it puts your hormonal rage under control, me and her have just been talking as of lately, That answer didn't seem to satisfy Quinn, but Santana really didn't care
None

She needed to go home, and make sure her mother wasn't hitting the sauce too hard again
None

She talked to Brittany about it, but most everything goes over that poor girl's head
None

If she hadn't slept with Finn, maybe she would talk to the former queen bee

Gotta go Q, she said, leaving Quinn alone in the auditorium.

None

When she got to her car, and attempted to turn it on, she let out a groan
None

Piece of shit! she snapped, slamming the steering wheel
None

There was a knock on her window, and she looked over and saw Mike Chang
None

She got out of her car, and she was met with a concerned smile from the Asian.

smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Everything ok? he questioned.

None

Stupid car won't start, she grunted
None

She was getting nervous now; normally she would be halfway home.

None

I can take a look at if you want...

None

I really just need to go home, she muttered darkly, hoping her mom hadn't hit her emergency flasks already
None

Mike looked at her strangely, and then shrugged his shoulders
None

If she needed to be home that badly, he could just take her home before taking a look at her car.

None

I can give you a ride, he offered, pulling out his keys
None

For the first time in a long time, Santana Lopez felt guilty
None

She had almost made him one of her friends with benefits, but Puck didn't want her to do that to him
None

She didn't want to lead him on.

None

Mikeâ€¦

None

Really it's no trouble, he promised, Come on, I'll take a look at your car this weekend, he said with a gentle smile
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

She just decided to take him on his kind offer.

None

Thanks Mike, she said, smiling lightly.

None

Rachel smiled as she sat down at the Puckerman table, Puck still looked nervous
None

Noahâ€¦ Rachel mumbled, grabbing his hand under the table
None

He flashed her a smile, and then shot a look towards his sister
None

She had been quiet for a while
None

Abbyâ€¦

None

Yes Noah? she questioned quietly.

None

You are kinda quiet, he observed, you barely said anything to Rachel-,

None

Why should I Puck? she snapped back harshly
None

She is just going to go away like your other girls, Puck felt like he got socked in the stomach
None

It hurt to see how his family thought of him
None

Rachel looked towards his sister, and saw guilt clouding her features
None

Noahâ€¦I'm sorry, she murmured.

None

Its fine, he said stiffly, taking his hand away from Rachel's
None

He remembered when little Abby Puckerman looked up to her big brother
None

Now all he was dubbed as was the Lima Loser; even in his own house
None

I'm going to see if Mom needs help, he grumbled.

None

I didn't mean itâ€¦ she murmured, playing with some of the silverware in front of her.

some has no Synonyms in the API
None

Why don't you go tell him that when he comes back in? Rachel suggested
None

Even though he doesn't talk a lotâ€¦ she said, scooting his chair over closer to the younger girl, I can tell he is really tryingâ€¦and would love his family's support, Abby nodded her head
None

Puck heard everything Rachel had said to his sister; and he heard what Abby said
None

Puck walked back in, his mom trailing behind him
None

Thank you for having me over Mrs
None

Puckerman, she said very respectfully.

None

Its no trouble at all dear, she said with a smile
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

It's nice to entertain again, she said
None

Its about time that I met the girl that Noah won't-, Puck shot his mother a look, and Rachel just laughed at him.

None

I'm really glad to be here, she murmured.

None

So what do you like to do Rachel? Rebecca Puckerman questioned.

None

Wellâ€¦as soon as my dads heard me sing, they had me perfect my voiceâ€¦and further solidified that I was going to become a starâ€¦ she frowned at that note; she wasn't even sure if she wanted to go to Broadway anymore.

None

Well that sounds great, Rebecca said
None

The night continued with small talk, and Puck sighed as his mother finally had to go to bed.

talk has no Synonyms in the API
None

Noahâ€¦that wasn't that bad was it? Rachel questioned, as she slung her jacket back on
None

Puck rubbed his eyes, and she leaned into him
None

Puck wrapped his arms around her
None

They just stood outside of his truck; he didn't want to drive Rachel home just yet
None

After a few minutes Rachel started to hum a song
None

It was Lean on Me, and hearing her hum that made him grin.

None

I guess it wasn't that badâ€¦I mean my mother could have been less of an interrogator, Puck admitted with chuckle
chuckle has no Synonyms in the API
None

But that's my ma for ya, he mumbled, I guess I should get you home, she shrugged her shoulders
None

What's up? he pressed.

None

Nothing, she murmured, giving him a kiss
None

He rolled his eyes, and pulled away, What? she questioned.

None

Babyâ€¦ he murmured.

None

I just don't want to go home right now, she said dodging the issue
None

Puck just accepted that answer, but figured that a drive would do them both well.

None

Come onâ€¦lets go take a drive, she nodded her head, and allowed him to lead her to the passenger side of his truck
None

For the moment she wasn't going to worry about the results of her tryoutâ€¦that was a worry for tomorrow

None

Rachel frowned as she readjusted the Cherrio skirt
None

She couldn't believe she was doing this
None

B, you look fine, Santana snapped, and you shocked the shit out of Sylvester, she observed
None

Rachel shrugged her jacket on over the outfit, and let her hair loose
None

It was such a pain to keep her hair up when it was shorter than it used to be
None

That and Puck wouldn't keep his eyes off of you during the whole practice, Rachel blushed, and the Latina snickered.

None

Britneyâ€¦ Rachel said as she turned around
None

She was going to ask what she thought, and saw her frowning at her lip gloss
None

Is something wrong? Santana looked towards her confused friend and rolled her eyes.

None

She forgot how to put on lip gloss again, she said in a soft voice
None

Brit come here, Rachel couldn't believe what she had heard
None

She shook her head and shrugged into her jacket.

None

Heyâ€¦I'm going to head home, she called over her shoulder.

None

I thought we were going to hang out-, Britney started to call back, but the Latina made her close her mouth.

None

We areâ€¦I just want to go change firstâ€¦and you guys shouldn't have to meet my dadsâ€¦ they were already mad that her cheerleading was interfering with her dance lessons, and her vocal lessons
lesson has no Synonyms in the API
None

She let out a low sigh.

None

Wellâ€¦alright, Santana said in a doubtful voice
None

The brunette Cheerio walked out of the locker room and started to head for her car
None

She thought she heard someone following her
None

She thought it might be Puck, and she turned around with a smile on her face
smile has no Synonyms in the API
None

Instead she was met with Karofsky.

karofsky has no Synonyms in the API
None

Umâ€¦.hi? she questioned, wondering what the hell he wanted
None

From what the other Cheerios told her, Karofsky was a bit of a horn dog
None

She reached into her purse for her keys, and fished them out.

None

Sup Berry? he questioned
None

She suddenly found herself nervous; she wanted Puck to be there
None

She had taken some self defense classes after her dad heard about the bullying going on around McKinley High School.

None

Just driving home, she said to him, unconsciously reaching for her pepper spray attached to her key ring.

None

Why so nervous? he questioned a smirk in place
None

He began approaching her, and she felt herself stumbling backwards
None

As she stumbled she saw her boyfriend's truck was still there
None

Rachel was hoping that he would appear soon; or even one of the Cheerios.

None

Iâ€¦ she swallowed, and began to think up a believable lie
None

He reached out, and placed a hand on her shoulder
None

He pulled her closer, and she immediately pushed him away
None

What the hell do you think you are doing? she questioned.

None

Come on Berryâ€¦ he said, I thought all Cheerleaders were loose,

None

That is a stereotype, she pointed out, and you know that I'm dating Puck, she snapped
None

His face turned into a scowl, and he attempted to slam his lips against hers
None

She let loose the pepper spray, and hit him directly in the eyes.

None

You bitch! he screamed, swinging blindly
None

She ducked under his swinging fist, and tripped him
None

At that moment, Puck came out looking for his girlfriend
None

When he saw Karofsky fall to the ground, he started running over towards her
None

Before he reached Rachel, Karofsky knocked her legs from under her
None

Rachel let out a scream as she hit the ground
None

Puck sprinted over to them, and yanked the guy off of her.

None

He punched Karofsky in the face, and then said in a deadly voice, Neverâ€¦ever touch her again, he shoved the other male roughly away
None

Before he could think of going after the other teen again, he felt a hand on his shoulder
None

He turned around, Are you alright? he questioned
None

She nodded her head, and then buried herself into his body
None

He immediately wrapped his arms around her drawing her in close.

None

Thank god you got here, she mumbled into his chest.

None

Come onâ€¦ he mumbled, starting to pull her away from her car
None

He wanted to get her far away from the school.

None

I got to go homeâ€¦ she started, My dads wanted me clean up the houseâ€¦ Puck seemed very reluctant to let her go home
None

And I just want to change into some comfy clothes,

None

I am going to follow you home, Puck said.

None

Alright Noahâ€¦ she whispered nervously
None

Doâ€¦do you think we should talk to the cops? He wasn't sure; he had never been in this kind of situation.

None

I don't know babe, he mumbled, maybe we should talk to my momâ€¦ he had never really asked his mom for help before.

None

Iâ€¦I don't knowâ€¦ she whispered, but then realized, she really couldn't just talk to Puck about this
None

She found his arms wrapped around her once more
None

She felt her body relax into his bigger frame
None

She buried her face into his chest, and felt his hands running up and down her back
None

I really don't want to bother your mom with thisâ€¦

thisâ€ has no Synonyms in the API

He looked down at her, Racheâ€¦my ma loves you
None

Once she found about us dating earlier, she nearly killed me for losing ya, he said with a playful grimace
grimace has no Synonyms in the API
None

Besidesâ€¦after what that asshole nearly pulledâ€¦ Rachel shuddered, Godâ€¦babe don't cryâ€¦

None

I'll be alright, she sniffled.

None

Come onâ€¦lets get you some comfy clothes, he murmured, I'll see what me and Abby can cook up tonight,

None

Noahâ€¦ Rachel started to object.

None

Rache, its happening stop fighting me, she sighed and nodded her head.

None

He made sure that she was in her care safely before heading to his truck
None

As he was driving he couldn't help but worry about Rachel, and what almost could have happened to her
None

Before he knew it they arrived at the Berry's house
None

Just wait out here for two minutes ok? Rachel mumbled
None

Puck just nodded his head, and waited outside of his car
None

As Rachel walked into the house, she pulled out her cell phone
None

Santana had seen the tail end of the tussle with Puck, but he had hustled Rachel out of the parking lot so quickly she didn't get a chance to check up on her new friend.

None

 Rachel texted back as she went up the stairs to change into a pair of comfier clothes
None

Before Santana could shoot her another text, 

None

She closed her phone, and went back outside
None

Her father's weren't coming home for another day or so; she deduced that leaving a note was quite pointless
None

As soon as she got near his car, Puck hopped off the hood of his truck
None

He opened up the passenger door, and she climbed inside.

None

Noahâ€¦ she murmured, as he began driving towards his house
None

He was still fuming about what the other football player had tried doing
None

Rachel slowly reached her hand out and placed it on his shoulder
None

Noah, she repeated, and he took at a glance at her.

None

Sorry Rachel, he said, once again focusing on the road
None

He took one hand off the steering wheel, and grasped her hand lightly
None

His fingers running along the tops of her knuckles seem to soothe the both of them
None

You alright? he questioned.

None

As ok as I can be, she answered truthfully
None

They came to a stop in front of his house, but before she could get out of the truck, he was pulled into his embrace
None

She could tell he was still furious about what the other football player had done
None

It really hadn't hit her what could have happened if Puck hadn't shown up
None

After a few minutes, Puck pulled away
None

As they entered the Puckerman household, they were greeted with the sounds of Disney music

['greet', 'with', 'sound']

Rachel smiled lightly, and Puck was taken aback for a moment.

None

Why don't you go see what Abby is doing? he suggested lightly, I'll get started on dinner, he murmured, placing a kiss on her lips
None

He didn't want to really sing Disney songs with his kid sister, but Rachel seemed to love the Disney that was leaking from his sister's room
sister has no Synonyms in the API
['sing', 'song', 'with', 'sister']

Go on babe, he mumbled lightly smacking her on the butt
None

As soon as his hand left there was this weird look on his face.

None

Before she could say anything, the Disney Music was turned off
None

His little sister appeared and as soon as she saw Rachel she ran over to her
None

Hi Rachel! she squealed, tackling her into a hug.

None

Hi Abby, she said with a small smile.

smile has no Synonyms in the API

I didn't know you were coming over today! she said

Noah you didn't tell me she was coming over you jerk!

smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

Abby didn't seem to notice her big brother's odd mood, but Rachel did
None

Rachel is staying over for dinner tonightâ€¦what should we make? he questioned.

None

I don't know, she said, pulling away from Rachel
None

Mommy said something about making something when she got home
None

So we can just watch TV, she grabbed Puck's hand, and then Rachel's
None

She dragged them to the couch and turned on the tv.

None

Tina Cohen-Chang bit her lip; she knew something horrible had happened
None

There was no way that she couldn't say anything
None

She soon found herself outside of Emma Pilsbury's office
None

She saw that the car of the School Counselor was still there
None

She let out a sigh, and knocked on the door
None

Emma Pillsbury opened it up, and was surprised to see Tina there
None

Your name isâ€¦.Tina right? Tina nodded her head.

None

Iâ€¦I..
None

she hadn't stuttered in such a long time, but she was feeling so guilty for not saying anything or trying to stop the football player
None

Tears started coming from her eyes, and the counselor pulled her into the office
None

She was handed a box of tissues, and when she was finally able to talk without much interruption she began her story of what she saw happen to Rachel Berryâ€¦

None

Rachel Berry fidgeted in her chair; one moment she had been in class and then she was pulled out to be put in the Principal's office
None

Her dads and Miss Pilsbury were there waiting for her
None

Heyâ€¦ she said; she was quite perplexed
None

What's going on? she nervously pulled down on her short skirt
None

Her dads weren't used to this new style she had been putting on lately, and felt uncomfortable.

None

Rachelâ€¦we heard some disturbing news, Principal Figgins started.

None

What the hell happened Rachel? Why didn't you-, David started
None

His husband restrained him with a calming hand, and he softened his tone.

hand has no Synonyms in the API

I am still not sure what you are talking about, she said, rolling her shoulders back
None

Rachel wondered if Rebecca Puckerman had said anything
None

She didn't think she would and as mad as Noah was he promised he wouldn't tell anyone
None

He definitely was her bodyguard whenever she roamed the halls of the school.

None

Rachelâ€¦we had a student step up and say that they saw something very disturbing, her face paled; someone else had seen the altercation with David Karofsky? Emma Pilsbury sat her down.

karofsky has no Synonyms in the API
None

Rachelâ€¦honey, Alan started, and she shook her head.

None

Nothing happened, she sighed; it reality it could have been a lot worse for her
None

She was prepared for something bad to happen and her boyfriend jumped in and saved her.

None

Rachel this school has enough problems with the iced beverages being thrown, which is bad enough on its own, but something like this we are not going to stand for
None

She sighed.

None

Ok
None

I don't know why he tried, she emphasized the last word, to do what he did, it didn't go very far
None

I got scrapes mostly; Noah Puckerman made sure that nothing more than that happened, she said
None

Can I please go back to class I really don't want to talk about this, she said getting up.

None

We plan on suspending Mr
None

Karofsky, he said to her.

None

Okay, she said simply
None

Can I please go now? as much as the adults wanted to talk with her, she simply wasn't going to have it.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

Are you sure you don't want to go home honey? her dads asked her
None

She shook her head, and headed back to class
None

She bit her lip and pulled out her phone
None



None

 She sent the text and put her phone away
None

Before she hit the classroom, her phone vibrated, and Puck had responded to her
None



None

 She decided she would tell him when class was over
None

For the rest of class she found herself distracted
None

As soon as the bell rang, she walked out of the classroom and towards her locker
None

Puck was waiting for her
None

Rachel what's going on? he asked.

None

Got pulled into Figgins office, she said
None

I guess someone else saw what Karofsky did, she murmured
None

He stiffened slightly
None

He gently placed his hands on top of hers.

None

Are you ok? he asked.

None

Yeah, she sighed, I'm alright, she said
None

Let's not talk about this ok? she asked; she just wanted to forget and have fun like they have been doing
None

Puck let out a sigh, but nodded his head.

None

Alrightâ€¦ he took his hand off of hers, and threw an arm around her shoulders, bringing her close
None

He knew that they really should talk about this, but once Rachel made up her mind, she wasn't likely to change it
None

It was odd; she was being quiet again
None

Rachel Berry a year ago would have been talking non stop about something; especially something huge
None

Yet her she was being silent.

None

Noah, she said, looking up at him
None

He blinked a couple times and looked down at her
None

Really I'm ok, she said to him.

None

After a few hours, things seemed to swing back into normal
None

Rachel acted like nothing was wrong during lunch; in fact the only thing that was seemingly off was Rachel not looking forward to Glee
None

You normally love singing your ass off, he said to her
None

She laughed lightly.

None

I guess, but it's hard to tell who's actually a true friend there, she said
None

In fact besides Noah, Santana and Brittany, she wasn't sure where she stood with the rest of the group

Mr
None

Shue was always supportive; but that was just a teacher.

None

Well you got a few, he whispered, bringing her close.

None

I know, she said, smiling warmly
None

She wondered what was going to happen when her and Puck showed for Glee
None

As they entered the room, she could see that Mercedes and Kurt at least looked apologetic, but didn't really approach them either
None

She shook her head.

None

Wellâ€¦ Mr
None

Shue cleared his throat and looked at the group

We'll be ok to perform Mr Shue, Mercedes said
None

It's not a big deal,

Rachel rolled her eyes
None

It seemed that she only had a few true friends in this club at this moment
None

How could someone say they are worried, but don't even check up on you at all
None

Mr
None

Shue sighed; this wasn't the time to really try and wring them out.

None

This week, he decided, standing up and walking to chalk boards
None

We are going to be focusing on songs that express what we are feeling, and then songs that will help us get over problems
None

Since no one wants to talk about it, maybe this is easier, With them having their 'assignments' Rachel and Puck began to walk out the door.

None

Rachel wait up, Mercedes and Kurt came over to them.

None

Yes? she questioned, letting out a sigh.

None

We just wanted to apologizeâ€¦

None

It wasn't right of us to say anything about you two, Mercedes said
None

They didn't add too much more to the apology.

None

That's it? she asked
None

You aren't going to apologize for all the things you guys say behind my back
None

This is high school; I hear everything you guys say behind my back, with that she turned around, and stormed out.

-PRON- has no Synonyms in the API

None

Hell yeah, he said to her.

None

Squeals of excitement and peals of laughter filled the air around the playground, as a small circle of girls and boys of differing ages stood watching, as two of their number stood toe to toe
None

Two girls no more than eight years old stood in the centre of their friends, glaring at each other, a small deflated ball forgotten on the floor between them
None

They had been arguing since the start of recess, and what had initially started as a small altercation over a burst ball, had quickly degenerated into a full blow argument.

The smaller redheaded girl known to all as Ashley said crossing her arms over her chest
None

She looked around pleased at the wide eyes and the chorus of 'ohhh's' that followed her words.

None

We're not poor! The slightly taller blonde haired girl known as Olivia replied, her lips pursing in anger at the insult the other girl had thrown at not only her, but her Mom to.

None

You are, look at how you're dressed
None

Ashley ran her eyes up the length of the other girl's body and the turned to her friends with a giggle.

None

What's wrong with how I'm dressed? Olivia asked as she looked down at her outfit
None

She had her favourite panda t-shirt and pink shorts with electric blue sneakers
None

It was a cute outfit, she looked cute in it, and her Mom had told her so when they had picked it out together that morning.

None

Ashley rolled her eyes, pulled a face to her friends who stood behind her
None

She then fixed her gaze upon Olivia's outfit once more and smiled as she suddenly though of something nasty to say to Olivia
None

Like you're poor, you look like one of those homeless people who sleep in boxes by the side of the gym in town.

None

Olivia's mouth dropped open at Ashley's words
None

She didn't understand why the other girl didn't like her and why she was saying such horrible things
None

She had never done anything mean to her or said anything bad; they even used to be friends
None

Shaking her head Olivia pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes, I do not
None

Why are you being so mean? I said I was sorry for bursting the ball, it was an accident.

None

Well it's not good enough, besides I don't accept apologies off the homeless
None

As Ashley's words ripped through the air a series of giggles from the kids around them filled the air and Olivia felt her eyes sting with tears

['st', 'with', 'tear']

They were laughing at her and it hurt.

None

I said I'm not homeless
None

Olivia said in a quiet but determined voice
None

Sure they didn't have a lot of stuff, but they had everything that they needed
None

More importantly they did have a house.

None

Then there is your house.

None

Yeah I live in a nice house, it's not made of cardboard or anything
None

Olivia responded in a matter of fact way that earned her a few chuckles from the people standing closet to her that took her honest words as her being sarcastic
None

The giggles and the words just earned her another glare of hatred from Ashley.

None

Yeah, but it's not a nice as mine
None

Ashley said loudly with a roll of her eyes so everyone could hear
roll has no Synonyms in the API
['say', 'with', 'roll']

She loved to point out that her Daddy was rich and she had a pony and they had a TV's in every room in their house.

None

Well..
None

we moved
None

Olivia regretted the words the second they left her lips
None

They hadn't moved at all, she just wanted to shut Ashley up, and at that point Olivia found herself willing to say anything.

None

From the gym? Ashley asked with a small pride filled smirk upon her lips
smirk has no Synonyms in the API
None

She was clearly pleased with her insult and so were her friends by the calls of 'good one' and 'nice' that followed them.

None

We didn't live at the gym with the homeless
homeless has no Synonyms in the API
['live', 'with', 'homeless']

Olivia shouted as she slammed her fist into her thigh her frustration with how the other girl was treating her getting the best of her.

None

Ashley shrugged her shoulders in response, Whatever, you didn't move my Mom would know and she would have told me.

None

Your Mom doesn't know everything and yes we did move
None

Olivia persisted with her lie, her head bobbing up and down as she tried to convey that she was feeling confident and she was telling the truth.

['persist', 'with', 'lie']

Ashley looked over her shoulder towards her friends who nodded encouragingly
None

She then turned her attention back to her target and folded her small arms across her chest
None

Where did you move to then?

None

The..
None

the..
None

Olivia stuttered, she hadn't through that far ahead
None

Olivia's mind started to work overtime as she thought of a place she and her Mom could have moved to
None

A place better than were Ashley lived
None

Somewhere bigger
None

She had just wanted to make her stop talking and insulting her
None

She just wanted her to quit saying that she and her Mom were homeless and lived by the gym.

None

See, poor, homeless and a liar
None

Ashley snorted earning another chorus of 'yeah's'.

None

I'm not a liar, Olivia worried her lips as she ran though all the houses near where they lived
None

All of them sucked, or people lived in them
None

Suddenly her eyes lit up as she thought of the perfect place she and her Mom could have moved to.

None

The street next to the park was full of big old rich people's houses
None

She walked down it with her Gran every time that they went to the park
gran has no Synonyms in the API
['walk', 'with', 'gran']

One of the houses in particular was bigger than the rest
None

It sat at the end of the road and backed onto the forest
None

Olivia had asked her Gran about it once and her Gran had told her that it belonged to some really rich people.

None

Olivia guessed that even Ashley's parents weren't that rich, they didn't live near the park or have a house that backed onto the forest and that house, well It was the biggest house in Lima, Olivia was sure of it
None

It was way bigger and better than were Ashley lived
None

It was perfect
None

We moved to the big house at the edge of town.

None

Ashley's eyes widened and Olivia could tell she knew what house she was talking about
None

Everyone knew that house
None

No way
None

My Daddy says that no one lives there anymore, especially not you.
None
