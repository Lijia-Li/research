Squeals of excitement and peals of laughter filled the air around the playground, as a small circle of girls and boys of differing ages stood watching, as two of their number stood toe to toe. Two girls no more than eight years old stood in the centre of their friends, glaring at each other, a small deflated ball forgotten on the floor between them. They had been arguing since the start of recess, and what had initially started as a small altercation over a burst ball, had quickly degenerated into a full blow argument.
"You and your Mom are poor Olivia." The smaller redheaded girl known to all as Ashley said crossing her arms over her chest. She looked around pleased at the wide eyes and the chorus of 'ohhh's' that followed her words.
"We're not poor!" The slightly taller blonde haired girl known as Olivia replied, her lips pursing in anger at the insult the other girl had thrown at not only her, but her Mom to.
"You are, look at how you're dressed." Ashley ran her eyes up the length of the other girl's body and the turned to her friends with a giggle.
"What's wrong with how I'm dressed?" Olivia asked as she looked down at her outfit. She had her favourite panda t-shirt and pink shorts with electric blue sneakers. It was a cute outfit, she looked cute in it, and her Mom had told her so when they had picked it out together that morning.
Ashley rolled her eyes, pulled a face to her friends who stood behind her. She then fixed her gaze upon Olivia's outfit once more and smiled as she suddenly though of something nasty to say to Olivia. "Like you're poor, you look like one of those homeless people who sleep in boxes by the side of the gym in town."
Olivia's mouth dropped open at Ashley's words. She didn't understand why the other girl didn't like her and why she was saying such horrible things. She had never done anything mean to her or said anything bad; they even used to be friends. Shaking her head Olivia pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes, "I do not. Why are you being so mean? I said I was sorry for bursting the ball, it was an accident."
"Well it's not good enough, besides I don't accept apologies off the homeless." As Ashley's words ripped through the air a series of giggles from the kids around them filled the air and Olivia felt her eyes sting with tears. They were laughing at her and it hurt.
"I said I'm not homeless." Olivia said in a quiet but determined voice. Sure they didn't have a lot of stuff, but they had everything that they needed. More importantly they did have a house.
"Then there is your house."
"Yeah I live in a nice house, it's not made of cardboard or anything." Olivia responded in a matter of fact way that earned her a few chuckles from the people standing closet to her that took her honest words as her being sarcastic. The giggles and the words just earned her another glare of hatred from Ashley.
"Yeah, but it's not a nice as mine." Ashley said loudly with a roll of her eyes so everyone could hear. She loved to point out that her Daddy was rich and she had a pony and they had a TV's in every room in their house.
"Well... we moved." Olivia regretted the words the second they left her lips. They hadn't moved at all, she just wanted to shut Ashley up, and at that point Olivia found herself willing to say anything.
"From the gym?" Ashley asked with a small pride filled smirk upon her lips. She was clearly pleased with her insult and so were her friends by the calls of 'good one' and 'nice' that followed them.
"We didn't live at the gym with the homeless." Olivia shouted as she slammed her fist into her thigh her frustration with how the other girl was treating her getting the best of her.
Ashley shrugged her shoulders in response, "Whatever, you didn't move my Mom would know and she would have told me."
"Your Mom doesn't know everything and yes we did move." Olivia persisted with her lie, her head bobbing up and down as she tried to convey that she was feeling confident and she was telling the truth.
Ashley looked over her shoulder towards her friends who nodded encouragingly. She then turned her attention back to her target and folded her small arms across her chest. "Where did you move to then?"
"The... the..." Olivia stuttered, she hadn't through that far ahead. Olivia's mind started to work overtime as she thought of a place she and her Mom could have moved to. A place better than were Ashley lived. Somewhere bigger. She had just wanted to make her stop talking and insulting her. She just wanted her to quit saying that she and her Mom were homeless and lived by the gym.
"See, poor, homeless and a liar." Ashley snorted earning another chorus of 'yeah's'.
"I'm not a liar," Olivia worried her lips as she ran though all the houses near where they lived. All of them sucked, or people lived in them. Suddenly her eyes lit up as she thought of the perfect place she and her Mom could have moved to.
The street next to the park was full of big old rich people's houses. She walked down it with her Gran every time that they went to the park. One of the houses in particular was bigger than the rest. It sat at the end of the road and backed onto the forest. Olivia had asked her Gran about it once and her Gran had told her that it belonged to some really rich people.
Olivia guessed that even Ashley's parents weren't that rich, they didn't live near the park or have a house that backed onto the forest and that house, well It was the biggest house in Lima, Olivia was sure of it. It was way bigger and better than were Ashley lived. It was perfect. "We moved to the big house at the edge of town."
Ashley's eyes widened and Olivia could tell she knew what house she was talking about. Everyone knew that house. "No way. My Daddy says that no one lives there anymore, especially not you."
